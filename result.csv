3,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/us-announces-sanctions-north-korea-missile-tests-rcna19784,world,"SEOUL, South Korea — The U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions Friday after North Korea had tested parts of its biggest intercontinental ballistic missile in two recent launches, a sign it is likely to fire that weapon soon to put a spy satellite into orbit in what would be its most significant provocation in years.The Treasury Department noted a March 4 ballistic missile launch in unveiling restrictions against three Russian-based entities that aided ongoing development of North Korea’s military capabilities. The companies are Apollon, Zeel—M and RK Briz; two individuals tied to those companies will also be sanctioned.The sanctions block access to any U.S. assets held by these companies, as well as Apollon director Aleksandr Andreyevich Gayevoy and Zeel—M director Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Chasovnikov, who also controls RK Briz.Separately, South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it detected signs that North Korea was possibly restoring some of the tunnels at its nuclear testing ground that were detonated in May 2018, weeks ahead of leader Kim Jong Un’s first summit with then- President Donald Trump. The ministry didn’t say whether it believes the North was restoring the site to resume tests of nuclear explosives.North Korea’s neighbors detected two ballistic launches last week. North Korea later said it was testing cameras and other systems to be installed on a spy satellite but didn’t disclose what missiles or rockets it used.After analyzing the launches, the U.S. and South Korean militaries concluded they involved an ICBM system under development that North Korea first unveiled during a military parade in October 2020.“The purpose of these tests, which did not demonstrate ICBM range, was likely to evaluate this new system before conducting a test at full range in the future, potentially disguised as a space launch,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement Thursday.South Korea released a similar assessment and said North Korea must immediately stop any act that raises tensions and regional security concerns.North Korea latest tests were intercontinental ballistic missile system: US officialsMarch 11, 202200:31The ICBM in focus is the Hwasong-17, North Korea’s biggest missile, which could potentially fly up to 9,320 miles, far enough to strike anywhere in the U.S. and beyond. The 82-foot missile, which was shown again at a defense exhibition in North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, last year, has yet to be test-launched.North Korea has already demonstrated the potential to reach the U.S. mainland with flight tests of other ICBMs, the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, in 2017. Some analysts say developing a larger missile could mean the country is trying to arm its long-range weapons with multiple warheads to overcome missile defense systems.In 2018, North Korea unilaterally suspended long-range and nuclear tests before it entered now-dormant denuclearization talks with the United States. The talks collapsed in 2019 due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on the North. Top North Korean officials recently hinted at lifting the 2018 weapons test moratorium.Seoul’s statement about North Korea’s nuclear testing ground came after recent commercial satellite images showed a possible resumption of construction activity at the site in the northeastern town of Punggye-ri. It was used for the North’s sixth and last nuclear test in 2017.After declaring the site’s closure, Kim invited foreign journalists to observe the destruction of tunnels in May 2018. But North Korea didn’t invite outside experts to certify what had been destroyed. Analysts who studied the satellite images say it’s unclear how long it would take for the North to restore the site for nuclear detonations.North Korea’s two missile launches were the latest in a string of tests in recent months, an apparent attempt to modernize its arsenal and pressure the Biden administration as nuclear disarmament talks remain stalled.Observers expect North Korea to launch the Hwasong-17 missile for two main military purposes — testing key weapons parts and putting its first functioning spy satellite in space. They say North Korea may claim that it is firing a rocket, not a missile, for a satellite launch, but the U.N. and others have viewed past satellite launches as disguised tests of its long-range missile technology.Satellite images show renewed activity at shuttered North Korea missile siteMarch 7, 202201:53Kwon Yong Soo, a former professor at Korea National Defense University in South Korea, said the estimated thrust of the Hwasong-17 suggests it is powerful enough to place multiple reconnaissance satellites into orbit in a single launch. He said North Korea would also want to test the missile’s engine parts.Kwon said the liquid-fueled Hwasong-17 may be too big and lack mobility given North Korea’s poor road conditions. He said the launch could be a show of force, but that a spy satellite could sharply increase the North’s capability to monitor the movements of U.S. aircraft carriers and other strategic assets.“If you want to use long-range strikes on moving targets like aircraft carriers, you need to receive data on their movement from satellites,” Kwon said. “If North Korea puts a spy satellite (in space), that will be an epoch-making development.”Jung Chang Wook, head of the Korea Defense Study Forum think tank in Seoul, said North Korea would want to test technologies that ensure multiple warheads of a missile could survive the extreme heat and pressure of reentry from space.Jung and Kwon both believe North Korea has acquired the reentry vehicle technology for a single warhead missile, an assessment that some analysts dispute.A spy satellite and a missile with multiple warheads were among an array of sophisticated weapons that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to develop to counter what he calls American hostility such as economic sanctions.“If North Korea succeeds in its test of a reentry vehicle for multiple warheads, that will tremendously boost its leverage in its negotiations with the United States,” Jung said. “It could be a game changer.”On Friday, North Korean state media said Kim visited the country’s satellite launch facility and ordered officials to modernize and expand it to fire a variety of rockets. Earlier this week, he said that North Korea needs reconnaissance satellites to monitor “the aggression troops of the U.S. imperialism and its vassal forces.”North Korea conducted two successful satellite launches from the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground in the northwest in 2012 and 2016. It said they were observation satellites under its peaceful space development program, but outside experts said they were designed to spy on rivals, though there is no evidence that the satellites ever transmitted images.Experts say North Korea could launch a spy satellite ahead of a major political anniversary in April — the 110th birthday of state founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un.Jung, the analyst, said he thinks the launch will likely come in early May, just before a new South Korean president takes office later that month.Kirby said the U.S. military ordered “enhanced readiness” among its ballistic missile defense forces in the region and intensified surveillance activities off the Korean Peninsula’s west coast.The launch, if carried out, would be North Korea’s most serious provocative act since its three ICBM tests in 2017."

It did not name suspects and gave no further details.According to the U.S. government, Aguililla is where CJNG leader Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera was born.Oseguera is among the most wanted men in Mexico’s criminal underworld. The CJNG is one of the most powerful gangs in the country and for years has waged brutal turf wars with rivals for control of trafficking routes in Michoacan on the Pacific coast.Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

""And the question is, where should these people go?""Meanwhile, Russian troops who have struggled for days to make progress against fierce Ukrainian resistance appeared to be regrouping in the woods north of Kyiv while the worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War Two continued to unfold.President Joe Biden on Friday called for an end to normal trade relations with Moscow, a move that would allow the West to raise tariffs on Russian products as it seeks to isolate and punish Moscow for the invasion of its democratic neighbor.The U.S. Treasury Department, which has already hit Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Kremlin allies with sanctions, issued a new round Friday targeting other Moscow elites and oligarchs including relatives of Putin's main spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov.In Warsaw, Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated the U.S. and NATO’s “commitment to defend, if necessary, every inch of NATO territory.”“An attack against one is an attack against all,” said Harris, citing Article 5 of the NATO treaty. Latest developments on Ukraine:Russian forces edged closer to Kyiv as the huge military convoy threatening the capital apparently dispersed.The number of refugees who have fled the country reached 2.5 million, the U.N. said.Russia launched new airstrikes against the western Ukrainian cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankiv, not far the the Polish border.President Joe Biden called for an end to normal trade relations with Moscow, the latest move to isolate it economically.Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a plan to bring in thousands of fighters from the Middle East. Russia expands its attack In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy continued to sound confident, saying he believed his country had reached “a strategic turning point” in its defensive war.“We are already moving toward our goal, toward our victory,” he said in a speech posted to Telegram early Friday, without providing specifics.“Ukrainians are proud people who always defend their land and will not give the occupier a single piece of land,” Zelenskyy added.But at the same time, Russian forces appeared to be preparing for a new offensive against Kyiv. At one point they appeared to be just 10 miles from the city center, a senior U.S. defense official said.Early Saturday, the U.K.'s defense ministry said the bulk of Russian ground forces appeared to be around 15 miles from the center of Kyiv.Moscow is likely seeking to “reset and re-posture its forces for renewed offensive activity” over the coming days, which it said would likely “include operations against the capital Kyiv,"" Britain’s defense ministry warned.Analysts have been monitoring a massive Russian military convoy threatening Kyiv that has been stalled outside the capital for days. But Maxar, a commercial satellite firm, said Friday the column had ""largely dispersed and redeployed,"" raising fears it may be regrouping.It could also be an attempt to reduce Russia's vulnerability to counter attacks from Ukraine, the U.K. defense ministry said Saturday, noting those attacks have taken a ""significant toll"" on Russian forces.

But missiles in Dnipro hit near a kindergarten, an apartment building and a two-story shoe factory, the Ukrainian state emergency service said.Heavy shelling also continued in the encircled cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol, the U.K. defense ministry said Saturday.  In the southern city of Odesa, thousands of residents were braving the bitter cold and filling sandbags with sand from its Black Sea beaches in anticipation of an amphibious Russian assault that was expected to happen in days.There were also reports that the Kremlin was trying to bolster its invasion forces by bringing in as many as 16,000 Syrian ""volunteers.""Speaking at a Russian security council meeting, Putin said he believed those who want to fight alongside Russian forces should be allowed to, Reuters reported.Humanitarian crisis worsensRussia intensified its attacks even as it faced growing global condemnation for launching an invasion that has prompted more than 2 million people to flee Ukraine, according to the United Nations refugee agency.Ukrainian authorities were redoubling their efforts to evacuate residents from the hardest hit areas Friday, with Zelenskyy saying as many as 100,000 civilians had been brought to safety over the past two days.But in the southern port city of Mariupol, where Russia has been accused of launching a deadly airstrike on a hospital, officials warned that a “humanitarian catastrophe” was unfolding, citing what they said was Moscow stifling attempts to evacuate civilians.Mariupol, a strategic city with about 400,000 residents, has been without heat, electricity and water for at least a week during freezing temperatures.Moscow claimed Friday that Russian-backed separatists had captured nearby Volnovakha, a small city in the Donetsk region that has also been encircled and bombarded. NBC News has not confirmed this development and Ukrainian officials have not commented.After diplomatic talks in Turkey this week with top Ukrainian and Russian officials yielded little progress, the West has voiced growing alarm that civilians could face the prospect of a chemical or biological attack from Russia.Kyiv has also accused Russia of firing at a settlement in Belarus near the border with Ukraine to give Putin’s ally, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, a pretext to send his soldiers into Ukraine.Belarus is already a staging area for many of the Russian troops who invaded Ukraine.Race to evacuate Ukraine’s sickest kidsMarch 12, 202201:59U.S. ramps up pressure With Russia showing no signs of stepping back from its military offensive, the U.S. and Europe sought to deliver a fresh financial blow to Moscow.Biden announced Friday that the U.S. and its allies from the Group of Seven will take steps to deny the ""most favored nation"" status designation to Russia, putting an end to normal trade relations and paving the way for higher tariffs. The European Union said it planned to do the same.Biden said the U.S. will also ban imports of Russian goods like seafood, vodka and diamonds and will join its allies in cutting off Moscow's ability to seek financing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.“Putin’s war in Ukraine will never be a victory,” Biden said. “We will not let autocrats and would-be emperors dictate the direction of the world.""The move would come just days after the U.S. banned imports of Russian oil and gas and as the West adds to an ever-growing list of sanctions targeting Russia's most powerful and wealthy. Some of the latest additions to that list, announced Friday, are billionaire Viktor Vekselberg and family members of Peskov, Putin's main spokesperson.The U.S. this week also warned Russia against seizing the assets of any companies that have joined the exodus of international business from the country.Putin insisted Russia would ""overcome these difficulties.""""Of course, there are problems connected to recent events,"" he said in televised remarks. ""There have always been attempts to curtail our development and they are happening now, obviously on a larger scale.""His comments came as Russia restricted access to Instagram, launched a criminal case against its parent company, Meta Platforms, and moved to designate it an ""extremist organization.""Russia was responding to Meta announcing a policy change allowing users to call for violence against Russian soldiers within the context of the war.Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, tweeted Friday that the social media platform ""will be blocked in Russia"" starting Monday.The development marks the latest crackdown on free speech in the country since Putin launched his invasion, further isolating Russia both economically and culturally."

10,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/absolutely-critical-ukraines-wartime-supply-chain-essential-defense-rcna19359,world,"Serhiy Prytula, a beloved television and radio show host in Ukraine, dreamed he would make an office building in downtown Kyiv into the headquarters of his new political party. From a table in front of a backlit cutout of Ukraine, he would help mold his country's future.Now that Russia has invaded Ukraine, his goal has shifted. Instead of a center for politics, the building has become a center to organize and coordinate supplies for military volunteers. Inside, there are no politicians or leaflets featuring candidates or talking points. There are only soldiers and volunteers picking up boxes full of medicines, canned food, bulletproof vests, helmets, uniforms and remote control drones that are used to surveil and drop bombs on the Russian military.Serhiy Prytula.Courtesy Serhiy Prytula“We don’t care about politics in Ukraine now,” Prytula said over the phone. “We are all soldiers or volunteers now, and we have only one question: How can we save our state?”Leveraging his fame and social media reach, Prytula has organized a major supply network. He is taking in donations, negotiating the purchase of bulletproof vests and helmets from manufacturers in countries like Turkey, pressuring car dealers to provide vehicles to the territorial defense at steep discounts, operating warehouses from Poland to Kyiv, and moving numerous buses and trucks full of supplies throughout the country.His work is just one example of the largest supply effort since the Cold War and the Berlin airlift. As millions of Ukrainians flee across the borders, numerous groups are coordinating how to move in humanitarian, medical and military aid to assist in the country's defense.Government agencies, NATO partners and philanthropic groups are amassed just outside the country helping refugees and boxing up supplies that will soon be taken into Ukraine. Russian army expands assault on UkraineMarch 12, 202202:58""This is a really intense situation where you have literally millions of people flowing out while you're trying to push supplies in — so you can imagine immediately the logistical issues here,"" said Sarah Mendelson, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Economic and Social Council and as a deputy at the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Obama administration. ""This is a very extreme high-wire act,"" she added. USAID said it had deployed its team of disaster experts to Poland to work with partners there and ""assess needs, identify assistance, and determine viable routes into Ukraine to determine assistance.""People cook outdoors for Ukrainian service members and civil defense members serving in Kyiv, Ukraine, on March 7.Vadim Ghirda / AP""The situation on the ground in Ukraine is rapidly changing,"" an agency spokesperson said. ""Ongoing hostilities continue to damage and destroy roads and bridges, as well as impacting train infrastructure, complicating relief operations. If humanitarian access does not improve, the already devastating situation will get even worse.""Multiple supply groups said the six-hour drive between Kyiv and Lviv, on the Polish border, takes about a day now. The situation has grown more difficult as Kyiv is increasingly encircled. Roads and bridges are damaged or destroyed, some routes are considered dangerous, and the movement of Russian troops and bombings mean that no corridor is guaranteed. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, told Reuters on Friday that the city had enough supplies to last for two weeks. Though the Russian forces are pressing in on Kyiv's edges, he said, supply lines remain open for the 2 million people who remain in the city.“We have right now electricity, heating, gas, we have water,” he told the news service. Moving supplies into occupied regions of the country — particularly near Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kherson — is nearly impossible, though Prytula and others said they had some luck in the past week. Meanwhile, finding space in warehouses near Lviv is growing difficult as they fill up with supplies for the war effort.Kseniya Kvitka, who works for the State Enterprise Medical Procurement of Ukraine, said over the phone that her agency is coordinating with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health to create a list of more than 300 items, from medicines to medical equipment, that they have asked suppliers and manufacturers inside the country to donate or sell at a steep discount. They also work with outside groups to ensure those supplies continue to move into the country. Meanwhile, using a central database the agency repurposed in the early days of the war, local hospitals and nearby military garrisons constantly upload the status of their reserves and insert requests when something begins to run low. Kvitka's agency then moves its supplies to 31 warehouses stationed throughout the country that the hospitals and military can access. The logistical challenges remain, she said, though it's not as ""ad hoc"" a process as it was at the start of the war. They are getting better at tracking and moving items throughout their network via trucks and outside contractors ensuring medicines don't get stuck in any one location. To reach harder-hit areas, they move some shipments via the Ukrainian railway service or just try to get it as close as possible, where locals may have a chance to pick them up. ""We try to have a bigger and clearer picture of all the warehouses and all the hospitals in all the regions, so they have all the needed medicines and equipment for the war wounded or the regular citizens,"" Kvitka said. Volunteers work at a donation and distribution center for medical supplies to be delivered throughout the country, in Lviv, Ukraine, on March 2.Daniel Leal / AFP - Getty ImagesUkraine's boundary line with Poland has provided essential entry points for support from the West, allowing the country to sustain its fight against Russia.Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based military think tank, said the 332-mile land border with Poland was ""absolutely critical"" to Ukraine's defense, though the borders with Slovakia, Romania and Hungary also have some supplies running through them. ""There are multiple routes from Poland into Ukraine, there's not one single road, so there are all sorts of other ways in, which probably they're using already,"" he said, explaining that the size of the border would be difficult for Russia to police even if it made its way west. ""It gives the Russians a real challenge.""Nevertheless, Russia has given stiff warnings to Ukraine's partners in the West that are providing aid — particularly military equipment. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned Thursday that foreign governments helping Ukraine “will be responsible for their actions.”That level of vitriol has made Poland nervous, experts said, and it is perhaps one reason why it wanted America to operate as a middleman and send Polish jets earmarked for Ukraine from a U.S. Army base in Germany.That is not the only tension point.  Royal Australian Air Force personnel load pallets of critical military equipment and medical supplies bound for Ukraine at RAAF Base Richmond, Australia, on March 1.  Cpl. Kylie Gibson / Australian Defence Force via AFP - Getty ImagesThe Polish government has been tracking a Russian military column in Belarus that has come to a stop near the Polish and Ukrainian border, just north of where many of the supplies are flowing through, said Michal Baranowski a senior fellow of the German Marshall Fund and the director of its office in Warsaw. That threat, a Russian missile that dropped within miles of the Polish border and the strategic significance of the Ukrainian supply line are also why the NATO ally has pushed for the U.S. to provide it with two batteries of Patriot anti-missile systems, he said.  ""Both here in Poland and in NATO headquarters, we take the possibility — perhaps intended or unintended — some level of escalation or spillover seriously,"" Baranowski said, noting that NATO allies in Eastern Europe noticed when Russian President Vladimir Putin said he wanted to push the border of the alliance back. ""We think it unlikely, but so many unthinkable things have already happened.""Unthinkable to Ukrainians, however, is that their war effort could fizzle out without that steady stream of supplies. It's a concept as difficult to consider as the immense need within the country. While Prytula has created a powerful supply center in Kyiv that moves equipment in bulk to soldiers, he still gets hundreds of individual calls every day pleading for equipment. Sometimes, it's a wife of a soldier asking for a bulletproof vest, other times it's an elderly person begging for a helmet. They are tough calls to field, but he said he and his growing team of volunteers remain focused on their mission.""Everyone understands what they need to do,"" Prytula said. ""That's why it's become a bit easier for me: I can share the responsibility and in this way we help each other."" "

His soldiers had opened fire on her family’s car, yet the officer was apologetic as the soldiers gave them first aid.While she lay there seriously hurt, she recalls him saying, “I’m sorry for doing this but we have an order to shoot everything that is moving, and you cannot imagine how many cars like this we have full of Nazis who are trying to bomb us,” Tetyana, 42, told NBC News on Wednesday from her bed in Kyiv City Hospital 17.Her husband, Roman, 50, and their daughter, Katherina, 16, were also hit in their legs. The officer’s comments echoed President Vladimir Putin’s accusations of Nazi elements within Ukraine, his stated reason for invading Russia’s western neighbor. Experts have slammed the allegations as slanderous and false. Tetyana, a former shop worker, said the Russian soldiers she encountered “truly believe that everyone around is a Nazi.” She added that the soldiers “were all terrified,” and she had spoken calmly with them prior to the shooting. Tetyana, Igor, Roman and Katherina Vlasenko, pictured a few years ago. Courtesy Roman VlasenkoAfter their house in the village of Vorzel was hit by a Russian strike on March 2, she said, they stayed with neighbors before deciding to leave the community just outside of Ukraine's capital Kyiv. The family had already fled from Kremlin rule in Crimea after Russian forces annexed the peninsula in 2014, her husband said. After driving up to the checkpoint at the end of their street, Roman, a former business consultant, said he asked the soldiers whether they could keep moving. “They asked him what his nationality was and why he spoke Russian so well,” Tetyana said. “They were surprised that we spoke Russian amongst each other. My husband said, ‘We have a free country here, everyone speaks whichever language they like,’” she added. “And I said, ‘Your brains are full of Putin propaganda crap. There are no Nazis here.’” They were waved through but got less than 40 feet before their car was fired on, Tetyana said.She added that she was “naive” when she “saw the bullets tearing through the glass and metal into the car.”   “I started to show them documents and saying there were kids,” she said. Roman Vlasenko in front of his family home in Vorzel after it was bombed.Courtesy Roman VlasenkoShe briefly heard Katherina screaming in pain. “I remember the bullet coming through my knee and my bone,” the teenager said. “After this I lost consciousness.”Roman “started to shout that they killed our daughter because she lost consciousness,” Tetyana recalled. Their 8-year-old son, Igor, was the only one who escaped unscathed, because Katherina had covered him, Roman said.   Roman added that he called one of his neighbors, who shouted at the soldiers when he saw what had happened, before helping to transfer them to the hospital where they are recovering. “I don’t know how we survived,” Roman said, sitting in a wheelchair at the foot of his daughter’s bed with his head in his hands. “I feel huge, huge guilt for what happened because I made this decision to risk the whole of my family. I will have to live with this for the whole of my life.”   "

I wanted to exchange experiences,” she said.She looked forward to embracing American high school customs — homecoming dances, performing in jazz choir concerts — before returning to her beloved homeland. But last month, Khrystyna’s world was turned upside down when Russian forces invaded Ukraine.  Khrystyna is among hundreds of Ukrainian exchange students in the United States who fear for the safety of their families and worry about what kind of homeland there will be to return to now that their country is at war.Future Leaders Exchange student Khrystyna.Courtesy of KhrystynaThere are 200 Ukrainian teenagers spending a year in American high schools as part of the U.S. State Department-sponsored Future Leaders Exchange Program, said Pam Blackburn, senior regional director of the Program for Academic Exchange, which helped place Khrystyna in Indiana. At the request of the exchange program organizers, students’ last names are being withheld, out of concern for their families’ safety in Ukraine.For weeks, students and their host families, who are in regular communication with the State Department, became increasingly concerned  about reports of Russian troops massing on the Ukrainian border and of an imminent invasion.  Still, Blackburn said, when the actual invasion began, it stunned many of the young exchange students, who struggled to come to terms with the idea that the peaceful homeland they’d said goodbye to just six months ago was suddenly under attack.In Khrystyna’s case, she was celebrating her 16th birthday at an indoor water park with her host family when she learned Russia had invaded Ukraine.“At first I didn’t believe it,” Khrystyna said. “You can’t know that your compatriots — your people, friends, family, will need to hide from bombs flying into their houses, need to fight for the future of your country. But then I texted my parents and saw all the news. It was pretty hard.”Her American host mother, Amanda Catt, stayed by Khrystyna’s side, working to make her feel safe. “That first night was hard,” Catt said. “We didn’t get any sleep. I held her and she cried.”Khrystyna’s family is staying, for the time being, in their home in Lutsk. But other Ukrainian exchange students’ families have fled.Gaylna, Oleg, Khrystyna, and (sitting) AndriyCourtesy of KhrystynaAnastasiya, 17, is studying at a high school in Portland, Indiana, this academic year, not far from the  school Khyrstyna attends. Anastasiya’s family remains a world away. They were in her hometown, Zaporizhzhya, until a week ago, when Russian bombs made it too dangerous to stay. Now they’re in search of a safe haven.“Six days ago they decided to move because Russian troops are coming, and they bombed all the towns around our city,” Anastasiya said. “They’ve been driving for six days. They’re moving so slowly because of traffic. They don’t know where they can stop.”Valdyslav, 17, says his hometown, Kharkiv, has come under repeated attack. He spends his days studying at a high school in Cincinnati,  but his mind and his heart are with his family in Ukraine, particularly his grandparents, whom he said he’s very worried about. “I try to contact them at least twice a day because of all the blasts and shelling in my town and because my city is only 20 miles from the border,” he said. “It’s a very dangerous place.”But while some students are able to reach their families by phone, others struggle to get through at all. Ukranian Future Leaders Exchange students (back row) Viktoriya, Anna, Khrystyna, (front row) Anastasiya, Dasha, and Valadyslav.Pam Blackburn“It’s very, very hard with data there,” said Anna, 17, who is from Mariupol and is spending the year in Fountaintown, Indiana. “Sometimes they can make phone calls, but it takes time. They also don’t have electricity at all so they use their cars to charge their phones or computers to text me that they’re OK, they’re still alive.”Some days, the students agree, the anxiety can be too much.Dasha, 16, who is attending Indiana’s Jay County High School, said she’s learned the hard way not to be consumed by deadly images of attacks that dominate social media feeds and the internet.“I started Googling the first day.

For two hours straight, I was on my phone, just crying the whole time.”These days, when the stress becomes too much, Dasha says she finds comfort in school and sports. “I also started taking long walks and reading books,” she said. “It helps.”The students’ host families and school communities are rallying to support them financially now that it’s difficult, if not impossible, for their parents to send money from Ukraine.“We’ve had schools come together and pay for the students’ meals for the rest of the year, pay for their extracurricular activities,” Blackburn said. “They’re paying for the exchange students’ phone services so that the students can call home any time they want.”Some schools are coming together to pay for the Ukrainian students’ prom attire. In other instances, Blackburn said, host communities are raising money for the exchange students’ families back in Ukraine.As to what will happen to the students when the school year ends, Blackburn said the situation is fluid. Future Leaders Exchange student KhrystynaCourtesy of Khrystyna“Our goal is to get these kids back home safely to their natural parents,” Blackburn said. “If that’s not possible because of the turmoil going on, the State Department will consider this on a case-by-case basis. We would never send the kids home to something not safe.”For now, the students’ families in Ukraine say they miss their children terribly, but are glad to know they’re in safe and loving homes, thousands of miles from the war.“Thank you,” Gaylna, Khrystyna’s mother, said through tears to Catt during a Zoom call this week. “We love you because you support Khrystyna.”As Catt hugged Khrystyna to her, Khrystyna’s mother grew emotional.“I want to hold Khrystyna in my arms, but it is much safer for her to be in the U.S.A. right now,” Gaylna said. “It’s a big relief for us.”"
14,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/russian-propaganda-targeting-spanish-language-users-proliferates-socia-rcna19153,tech,"Russia and its allies have been using their media platforms to target Spanish speakers with propaganda that is inaccurate or an incomplete picture of the invasion of Ukraine, worrying some about the impact it can have on U.S. Latinos and across Latin America.While the outlets broadcast in Latin America, their reach on social media platforms like Twitter and YouTube is more extensive.Actualidad RT and Sputnik both have Spanish-language websites. One of the top stories Wednesday on the Russia-owned broadcast channel Actualidad RT was a conspiracy theory that Russia has floated about the U.S.’s funding a biological weapons laboratory in Ukraine. Actualidad RT reported that China asked the U.S. to reveal details of the laboratory. The U.S. has said the allegations are false. Similar conspiracy theories about secret laboratories have also spread in some far-right circles. Actualidad RT, as well as Sputnik Mundo, have led in the avalanche of social media posts about the situation regarding people or places in Russia and Ukraine. Experts warned that Russia had been seeding misinformation about Ukraine across the internet in the lead-up to its invasion, although its English-language efforts have generally been drowned out by Western media. The same has happened in Spanish, and the number of posts has shot up since the invasion.The social media posts had more than 1.5 million engagements from Feb. 23 to March 2, according to an analysis by Omelas, a Washington, D.C.-based firm that has been tracking propaganda in Spanish for five years. The channels recently asked their Twitter followers to also follow their accounts on the Russian social media platform VK, as well as on Telegram.Actualidad RT has come a long way since its inception in 2009. It gets more total digital video views than any other Spanish-language channel, according to Omelas’ research. It has more than 18 million followers on Facebook and almost 6 million on its YouTube channel. It describes itself as being a “major source of alternative information in the West.” Although its headquarters is in Moscow, many of its  news anchors and correspondents are from Latin America.Ben Dubow, Omelas’ chief technology officer, said that  since January, there has been a narrative on Actualidad: “Ukraine is run by neo-Nazis who are about to commit genocide against the ethnic Russians, and it’s the duty of Russia to preserve world peace and to counterbalance the West that is so feckless.""“They’re not targeting American Spanish speakers because they want to get the truth out,"" he said. ""They’re targeting them because they want to sow discord and they want to create chaos.”Watchdog groups like Media Matters have also been looking into the proliferation of Actualidad RT’s posts. They pointed out a Facebook post that painted Russia and Ukraine as equal aggressors, which has gathered 132,000 reactions and 2.7 million views. Jacobo Licona, the disinformation research lead at Equis Labs, a research and polling firm, said the interactions on Actualidad RT’s social media accounts are higher than those for its accounts in English. They have also gone up since the invasion.From Jan. 1 to Jan. 31, Actualidad RT’s average daily interactions on Facebook were 52,000. And from March 1 to March 6, they shot up to an average of 130,000 a day.“There is a lot of content that is spreading in Latin America that reaches Spanish speakers in the United States, and vice versa,” Licona said.He said his biggest concern is that Latinos are more susceptible to such content because of the amount of time they spend on YouTube and other social media and because of how social media platforms moderate content in Spanish.Kremlin-funded outlets account for the vast majority of social media posts that are giving the Russian perspective. But other Spanish-language outlets, such as HispanTV, funded by Iran, and CGTN, funded by China, have also been defending Russia in their Spanish-language coverage of the invasion in what appears to be an effort to erode support for Ukraine. The Venezuelan-owned outlets VTV and teleSur have done so, as well.Recent reporting on teleSur said “nationalist forces” in Ukraine are blocking Ukrainians from evacuating. CGTN reported that the Russian state news agency Tass said the Russian defense minister said he has proof the U.S. financed a military biological program in Ukraine.In a quick glance at some of the websites' articles, the pro-Russian slant may not always be obvious. At times, nuances are deeper in the stories. Unless one is well-versed in the unfolding events, it could be tricky to decipher what is true, exaggerated or flat-out false, experts said.“What makes propaganda effective is that, by and large, it’s true. They might frame it differently, but by and large, they have something to fall back on to claim what they’re saying is real,” Dubow said.The outlets post mostly on Twitter and YouTube. They have Facebook accounts, as well, but don’t get as many engagements there.HispanTV, from Iran, has dedicated channels for different countries, such as Chile and Venezuela. It was a project of Iran’s former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had a close relationship with Venezuela’s late leader Hugo Chávez. The idea was to counter mainstream narratives in Spanish. HispanTV is more prominent on the Russian social media platforms VK and OK.ru  than on Twitter.Venezuelan teleSur was launched in 2005 under the government of Chavez as a socialist alternative to CNN. CGTN was launched in 2007.But all of the outlets have different goals. Dubow said HispanTV is more focused on promoting a positive image of Iran and teleSur is about promoting leftist movements, while Kremlin-controlled media are about creating chaos.“And that’s really their approach to information. It’s entirely an expression of power,” Dubow said, referring to Russian state media. “It’s not an exercise in truth-finding ... their goal is just to aggravate tensions within a country, to try to push civil conflict as much as possible, try to prevent any country that isn’t allied with them from having any sense of solidarity, any sense of shared mission that is necessary to a country’s development.”(Note: The author worked at RT's bureau in Miami from 2010 to 2012).

15,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/-was-memes-subtle-asian-dating-sparked-unexpected-lasting-relationship-rcna15694,tech,"Like most casual Facebook users, 26-year-old Jenny Ly had joined  Subtle Asian Dating hoping to have fun and potentially meet new friends. Little did she know the online community would lead her to her boyfriend.Three years after it was launched and more than 650,000 members later, the Facebook group Subtle Asian Dating, a matchmaking platform for Asians around the world, has become a birthplace of marriages, engagements and a slew of long-term relationships. It emerged as a spinoff of a group founded in 2018 by a group of Australian teenagers, Subtle Asian Traits, which shot to popularity — with more than 2 million members as of this year — as a hub for memes and discourse about the Asian diaspora experience. Subtle Asian Dating is one of numerous spinoff groups adopting the “Subtle Asian” banner for interests ranging from dating to fashion to cooking.A friend of Ly’s had posted her in the group as an “auction”: the group's equivalent of a dating profile, often composed by a friend and offering a facetious list of pros and cons about the person being 'auctioned,' along with a set of photos.When 27-year-old Michael Dulay, who lived an hour away, found the post and messaged Ly on Instagram, the two started chatting platonically. But after a series of virtual Netflix hangouts and, eventually, Covid-cautious outdoor dates, an unexpected romance blossomed. The Southern California couple moved in together within six months of meeting online. Now, they’ve adopted a puppy.“We never expected anything to come from it. I was in it for the memes,” Ly said. “But with the right person, things just feel right … Michael proved to me that if someone really loved you, they would show it. I’ve never felt more myself in a relationship before than with Michael.”To Dulay, who said their love story had practically fallen into their laps, Ly serves as the ""North Star” inspiring him to become the best version of himself. A real relationship can burgeon from the group, he said, if users are genuine about their intentions from the start.Jenny Ly and Michael Dulay.Jenny Ly and Michael DulayPathik Gandhi, 30, was living in Chicago when he reached out to Iowa City-based Destinee Soubannarath Gwee, 28, after seeing her auctioned in the group. The two were hesitant to meet up during 2020, before Covid vaccines became available, but hourslong FaceTime dates convinced them it was worth preparing for a visit.The relationship moved quicker than either had expected: both met each other’s families within their first few in-person dates and, by last June, they were engaged.Living in a predominantly white area, Soubannarath Gwee said dating apps didn’t present a wide selection of Asian matches. But the global reach of Subtle Asian Dating enabled her to find Gandhi.“I just figured it’d be a good idea to just try it out and see what would happen,” she said. “I don’t know if I was expecting to literally find the person I was going to marry off of a Facebook group.”Destinee Soubannarath Gwee and Pathik Gandhi.Giulia VastaYet because the platform — and its related spinoff groups — includes hundreds of thousands of users from anywhere in the world, distance can also make it more difficult to form connections. That was a hurdle for 29-year-old Vy Ly and 27-year-old Patricia Poon, who lived 1,200 miles apart when they met on Subtle Queer Asian Dating+, a spinoff group of SAD.Ly was living in Las Vegas when she met Vancouver-based Poon at the end of 2018, and the two — who married in April last year — now live together in Los Angeles, a city both had long dreamed of moving to.Less than two months after they began talking online, the pair’s first disagreement forced them to confront how they felt about each other. When Poon worried Ly might be questioning the viability of a long-distance relationship, she “panicked” and booked the next available flight to Vegas to see Ly.“I took a day off work so I could extend the weekend, and I think I was probably there within 24 hours,” Poon said.The couple said they were fortunate to have been able to afford international flights every month, and then to both work remotely once the pandemic hit, which enabled them to move in together in Vegas.Both said the Facebook group served initially as respite for those who don’t live in a large queer community. Neither was expecting to find dates, let alone love. But Ly caught Poon’s attention when she introduced herself in the group in hopes of making friends.“I just found her post very endearing, a little dorky, very funny,” Poon said. “I was like, okay, let’s just send this pretty girl some memes and see what happens.”Patricia Poon and Vy Ly.Emily LauSome couples, like 21-year-old Winnie Chen and 26-year-old Oliver Cee, are still making long distance work. When they first met through SAD at the start of 2020, she was in Chicago while he was in Toronto. Still, they began talking — and within a month, Cee told Chen he wanted to take her on a date.“I thought he was joking because he lived all the way in Toronto. I was like, no way this is going to happen,” Chen said. “He said that he was serious, and I said, ‘OK, if you’re serious, then come over.’”So, come over he did: Cee took a couple of days off work and made the 12-hour drive. Despite her uncertainty about the distance, Chen said all her feelings and rationale convinced her to take a leap of faith.The pandemic’s initial international travel restrictions kept them apart for nearly a year, but now the two see each other during Chen’s school breaks. They have a plan, she said, for moving in together after her graduation and alternating between life in the United States and Canada.“[The distance] was hard, but I think the thing that kept us going was just being able to talk to each other, showing that we care about each other and being able to call every day,” Chen said. “I got really lucky. I know that’s not the case for a lot of people: I’m the only one out of all my Asian friends that was actually successful in finding a partner [through the group].""Oliver Cee and Winnie Chen.Oliver Cee and Winnie ChenDespite the drawbacks of such a large network, couples said one perk of Subtle Asian Dating is the ability to scope out others' views and values before deciding whether to start a conversation. Particularly active users are more likely to draw attention, whether through posting or commenting in the group, from potentially suitable matches.But like Subtle Asian Traits, Subtle Asian Dating and its spinoffs have received criticism for their emphasis on the East Asian experience. Groups like Subtle Curry Dating, self-titled by and targeted more specifically at South Asians, aim to help close the representation gap.Fatimah Sarwar, 22, had always imagined herself with a tall, curly-haired man with a “nice beard.” So when Arman Mridha, 23, slid into her Instagram DMs, Sarwar was floored: “I was just like, ‘Oh, my God!’ It felt like my Prince Charming.”She had auctioned off her friend on Subtle Curry Dating, but Mridha found himself wondering about the woman who made the post instead. “Not to be like Joe from ‘You,’” he said, but he knew he wanted to meet her.“I was just thinking, ‘Should I message her?’ And I kept thinking about it, but I ended up not doing it,” Mridha said. “And then one day I was at work and I was like, ‘You know what, I just can’t keep putting it off. I just got to do it.' So then I sent her this really long DM.”As Mridha tossed his phone aside and waited in anticipation, Sarwar was immediately struck by the sincerity of the message that had just popped up on her screen. That was January 2019. Last July, the two New York City residents became husband and wife.“First joining, I had no expectations. I just thought it would be a funny Facebook group that would eventually turn into just meme posting,” Mridha said. “I would always see other people posting their friends and I’d be like, ‘Wow, I wonder if anything happens.’ And then I saw her and I was like, ‘OK, let me try.’”Fatimah Sarwar and Arman Mridha.Jayma OrinOn the other side of the world in Australia, 27-year-old Bradley Prasad and 24-year-old Ranika Nath might have never run into each other despite living 15 minutes apart in Sydney. But Subtle Curry Dating brought them together one day in early 2020 as Prasad scrolled through Facebook on his way to work.He said Nath, who had just been auctioned on the group by a friend, stood out in the sea of posts. After reading her ""pros and cons"" list and realizing she was exactly who he was looking for, Prasad conjured up a witty opening and scored a dumpling date.The couple is now slated to wed in April.Ranika Nath and Bradley Prasad.Stuck in a Moment PhotographyThough putting oneself out there on a platform as public as Facebook can be intimidating, Prasad said, the rewards can be just as intense. With users scattered all around the globe, members never know when a conversation — whether with someone a continent away or right next door — might unfold into a happily-ever-after. “People will think, ‘Oh, is that a real relationship [if they met online]? They’re not going to last.’ But it works,” Prasad said. “We’re not the only couple that’s gone through this. It’s worked for lots of people, and it will keep working because we show that it works and people want what we have, which is good.”"

17,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/instagram-adds-credits-ensure-black-creators-are-cited-work-rcna18972,tech,"Instagram announced Monday that it will introduce a special tag for professional accounts and influencers that ensures they receive credit for their content, an attempt to address complaints that Black users are not credited for starting trends or are shut out from profiting from them. The tag is available to business and creator accounts, and comes on the heels of nationwide discussions and content strikes by Black content creators who pushed out viral posts saying they do not receive credit for their work. Alexis Michelle Adjei, a data analyst, and Cameryn Boyd, an engineer, envisioned and created the label with these disparities and Black creators in mind, particularly that creators make a living off producing social media content and that Black creators should share equally in that, too, they said. Adjei said, ""Black creators and addressing that inequity in the creator ecosystem"" was top-of-mind when developing the new feature.Cameryn Boyd is an engineer at Instagram.Noemie TshinangaTwice as many white influencers are making upward of $100,000 a year as are Black ones who are making similar content to similarly sized audiences, according to a study published in December by MSL, a communications company, and The Influencer League, an educational organization. The report also found a 29 percent pay gap between white creators and all creators of color. ""We want to ensure that as Black creators’ content is being distributed as it already is, they are getting the proper attribution so that they have the opportunity to get all of those growth and monetization and career-starting opportunities like their contemporaries are,"" said Boyd, a Spelman College graduate. “It’s really critical, as we’re moving towards this new age where creators are so important and creators are really able to use their craft to support themselves in their lives, that Black creators are getting the same opportunity, as they’re already creating the content.”Alexis Michelle Adjei is a data analyst at Instagram.Noemie TshinangaAdjei and Boyd joined Meta in August 2020 before landing on the idea the following February. They worked on it with colleague Alexandra Zaoui, building it out together and pitching it across different teams at Instagram’s parent company, Meta, until eventually getting their own team, which prepared the feature to launch this week under the pair’s leadership.  Adjei, a Stanford University graduate, said the need for a formal credit was apparent, and it just took the right set of eyes at Meta to see it. “I think we were just so close to the need that we were able to see and we kind of had that same situation of like, why doesn’t this exist? And then we went the next step of like, let’s make it exist.”Adjei and Boyd said the attribution will not affect the algorithm, which determines what posts are in a user's feed. But since the algorithm already considers what type of content users previously liked, viewed or shared when determining how to personalize content to users, the reach of credited creators should continue to grow naturally as a result.“Now, you can just have this enhanced tag and the idea there was because we know that Black creators’ content was already going viral and was being shared,"" Boyd said. ""But they weren’t getting that attribution. The hope is that they will now get the credit and that piece of content where their contribution can be traced back to their accounts so that people have the opportunity to follow them and they can grow their influence.”Adjei and Boyd said the goal is to curb the problem of uncredited Black work. And for Black creators to go as viral as their content.Follow NBCBLK on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.CORRECTION (March 7, 2022, 2:07 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled in some places the last name of the data analyst who worked to develop the feature. She is Alexis Michelle Adjei, not Adijei."

19,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-spurs-l-writer-relearn-cantonese-embrace-culture-rcna18618,asian-america,"Jenny Liao is relearning Cantonese after years of rejecting it, saying she was inspired by the sense of community that came as a result of  anti-Asian hate crimes fueled by the pandemic. She’s like many who, amid the backdrop of a 339 percent increase in hate crimes, want to feel more connected to their culture, including re-embracing their Asian names, languages and identities. “As I relearn Cantonese, I feel myself becoming closer to my parents,” Liao, 32, said. “And that’s a gap that might take a lifetime to close.”The Los Angeles-based Asian American writer grew up speaking Cantonese at home in New York City. But her fluency dissipated as she prioritized speaking English due to the racism she experienced as a child, she said. Now, she can barely speak Cantonese beyond basic phrases. “That cost me the most important tie — to my culture and to my parents — which is the ability to communicate with them, and to talk to them.”Her mother, Huizhen, says she understands why her children would prioritize English over Cantonese. Though she doesn’t understand English, she was aware of the racist teasing her children endured at school, and their urgent need to show they belonged by speaking only English. Now, because none of her three children is fluent in Cantonese anymore, a lot of their conversations are carried through the help of translation apps. “If I don’t have my phone handy or my laptop handy, it’s just kind of like a guessing game.” Liao said. To study Cantonese, she is using a language learning app to rebuild her vocabulary, calling her parents more often to practice with them, and immersing herself in Cantonese movies. Liao hopes one day she will have a sophisticated conversation with her parents without relying on translation apps. “And for me, definitely prioritizing my ability to talk to my parents is my way of telling them that I love them and they mean a lot to me.”"
20,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/almost-11000-hate-incidents-targeted-asian-americans-pacific-islanders-rcna19592,asian-america,"Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have reported nearly 11,000 hate incidents against them between March 2020 and December 2021 — spanning the pandemic, according to a report published last week by Stop AAPI Hate.Data from the nonprofit group, which tracks self-reported hate and discrimination against AAPI communities across the United States, found verbal harassment made up the majority of these incidents. Physical assaults were the second-most reported, followed closely by deliberate avoidance of AAPIs. “I was waiting for my train to arrive when a kid who was about 12-14 years old struck me on the face from behind and yelled, ‘China!’ at me,” one respondent reported from New York City. “A woman nearby watched the whole incident, yet did not step in or acknowledge what happened. She simply moved away.”Nearly half of the hate incidents occurred in public spaces — mostly streets and businesses, but also on public transit and in public parks. Chinese Americans reported the most hate incidents out of all Asian ethnic groups, and women reported more than double the hate incidents than men did.Research released last week by the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum had revealed 74 percent of more than 2,400 AAPI women surveyed experienced racism or discrimination within the last 12 months.“I want to emphasize that it is the women that are having more of the life-threatening type of dangerous encounters,” Sung Yeon Choimorrow, the forum’s executive director, told NBC News last week. “We’re being targeted because of the stereotypes about us, that we won’t fight back, that we’re submissive.”Aside from verbal and physical abuse, reports to Stop AAPI Hate also described instances of being coughed at or spat on, as well as of facing discrimination in the workplace and finding their homes or community centers vandalized.One person described being terminated after unsuccessfully seeking help from supervisors after experiencing racism from customers and patients at work.“One day, an older woman was being racist towards me by telling my supervisor that she didn’t want me (because of my race) when I’ve never met or spoken to her before,” the person reported. “I told her to stop. She complained and I was fired for defending myself.”While Stop AAPI Hate publicly reports the incidents it receives in efforts to advocate for effective solutions, the group does not report them directly to law enforcement.“The vast majority of hate reported doesn’t technically involve crime,” cofounder Manjusha Kulkarni said in a statement to NBC News. “That’s why policing isn’t the solution to hate.”In the report, Stop AAPI Hate recommended states invest in culturally competent and language-accessible programs to support victims of hate incidents, as well as community-based violence prevention programs to build solidarity, rather than division, among Asian Americans and other communities of color.The organization said it is also supporting efforts to alleviate AAPI hate and discrimination through education.“Education is one of the most effective tools against racism, and implicit bias is learned early,” the report said. “Asian American studies programs promote racial empathy and solidarity, while decreasing bullying and harassment in schools, helping AAPI students thrive.”"
21,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/pixars-turning-red-highlights-complexity-asian-american-families-rcna18581,asian-america,"When searching for inspiration for her first feature film, Domee Shi, the Academy Award-winning director of Pixar’s short film “Bao,” turned to her relationship with her mother.The result is “Turning Red,” Pixar’s first feature-length film directed by an Asian woman that’s slated for release on Disney+ on March 11. The movie tells the story of a “confident and dorky” 13-year-old Chinese Canadian girl named Meilin Lee who lives in Toronto in the early 2000s. One day, she discovers that she’s imbued with magical, ancestral powers that turn her into a red panda any time she experiences intense emotions. But underneath the humor and fantasy of the film is a story about the relationship between a mother and her daughter and the struggles Meilin feels between being a dutiful daughter while experiencing the disarray of adolescence. In “Turning Red,” 13-year-old Meilin Lee, a confident but dorky teenager with a tightknit group of friends who are passionate about a boy band called 4-Town.Pixar / DisneyMeilin is voiced by Rosalie Chiang and her mother, Ming, is voiced by Sandra Oh.“What I hope this film opens up is a conversation for those in the Asian community. When you’re a young person, you’re going to disappoint your parents,” Oh told NBC Asian America. “It’s very hard for us, but you will and it’s OK. It’s natural and you need to find your own way.”Shi hopes immigrant children, especially Asian children, can relate to the changes Meilin goes through in the movie and how she eventually learns to accept them.“They have to figure out what world they belong to, how to honor their parents and their family’s expectations, but how to carve out this independent identity for themselves in this new world that their family is not from,” Shi said.The film depicts embarrassing moments for Meilin that Shi borrowed from her own life, including a scene in which Ming follows her daughter to school to spy on her, and is chased out by a security guard. Her classmates see her and burst into laughter.“With many Pixar films, it helps hit multiple generations with its storyline. You know, of course, it’s focused on 13-year-old Mei. But I think there are mothers who are going to watch this film and hopefully feel seen and understood,” Oh said.Everything is going great for 13-year-old Meilin — until she begins to “poof” into a giant panda when she gets too excited, featuring the voices of Rosalie Chiang, Ava Morse, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan and Hyein Park as Mei, Miriam, Priya and Abby.Pixar / DisneyMing and Meilin’s relationship changes as the girl wrestles with growing pains, something her mother struggles to accept. Shi hopes viewers can relate to and find relief in the ups and downs of Meilin and Ming’s relationship. “I think, especially for immigrant kids, Asian kids, and for Mei in the movie, I think she has to come to realize that there is no perfect relationship with your parents, that it is always going to be messy,” she said.“We really wanted to explore the nuances of Asian parent-child relationship in dealing with change, and of intergenerational conflict and how it can shape who we become,” Shi said during a press conference in January. The film also stars Maitreyi Ramakrishnan (""Never Have I Ever""), Ava Morse and Hyein Park as Meilin’s best friends, and Finneas O’Connell and Jordan Fisher as singers in the fictional boy band 4*Town. The movie also features original music by Billie Eilish and O’Connell.“Turning Red is quirky, and surreal, but at its core, it is a mother and daughter finally embracing change in all of its messy, and furry forms, even if it means saying goodbye to the relationship you once had,” Shi said."
22,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/ali-wongs-ultrasexual-comedy-profound-fear-asian-american-women-rcna19032,asian-america,"Only about five minutes into her latest stand-up special, “Don Wong,” comedian Ali Wong, dressed in a loud red leopard print dress, struts around the stage and declares just how enthusiastic she is about certain sex acts. “Whenever I get a deep tissue massage, the masseuse is always like, ‘Do you sit and work at a computer all day?’” Wong said before explaining exactly how her sexual exploits got her physically tensed up while the audience swiftly dissolves into a mix of screams, giggles and nervous laughter.Wong’s special is filled with similarly hedonistic lines — raunchy, blunt and shamelessly honest. While the topic of sex is no outlier in the tradition of stand-up comedy, experts say the way Wong articulates her own sexual yearnings as an Asian American woman is powerfully significant against a backdrop of the group’s often having been cast as helpless objects of desire. And it’s especially profound to see an expression of sexuality that’s not through the white male lens at a time of heightened fear and anxiety among Asian American women, about 74 percent of whom reported in a new study having personally experienced racism or discrimination in the last 12 months. In much of her special, her third with Netflix, Wong lays claim to her sexual fantasies, many of which she says are part of her “midlife crisis.” Wong details how “being the breadwinner of my family has turned me into a 50-year-old man,” expresses how much she wants to cheat on her husband after a decade together and laments the abysmal quality of the male groupies straight female comics get, in comparison to the “young, hot” women whom mediocre male comics attract. And while Wong’s previous specials deal heavily with commentary around marriage and motherhood, “Don Wong” is more personal, firmly about what she wants for herself after having achieved her level of fame and success. Experts said previous hypersexual images of Asian women were, in part, formed by Western imperialism and racist legislation, only to be further confirmed by Hollywood depictions conjured up by predominantly white male gatekeepers. The image is far from innocuous, creating a perception that Asian American women are less of a threat and easier to take advantage of and that they aren’t going to fight back. Experts said it also puts the onus on Asian women to avoid violence. Catherine Ceniza Choy, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, Berkeley, said any conversations around sex and Asian American women have existed in the realm of fear and real danger. Many such discussions have been prompted by incidents from the spa shootings in the Atlanta area, in which eight people — six of them Asian women — were killed to the recent killing of Christina Yuna Lee, who was stabbed to death in New York. In addition to first-degree murder and burglary, the suspect in Lee's slaying was charged with “sexually motivated burglary” — defined as a burglary committed for the purpose of his own direct sexual gratification. Wong, in her own subtle way, alludes to the threats to safety many women feel, referring to “Silence of the Lambs”-type men in her DMs while simultaneously underscoring that the Asian American female experience isn’t defined by just tragedy. There are also joy and pleasure. Although Wong leans into her hypersexuality, leaving little to the imagination, it’s significant that white men aren’t involved in defining her fantasies, said Anthony Ocampo, a sociology professor at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. “The hypersexualization of Asian women by white men doesn’t mean that Asian women shouldn’t be afforded sexual agency,” Ocampo said. “Asian women like Ali Wong should have free rein to determine how much or little they want to share about their sexual lives because our sexual lives are part of our humanity. Shouldn’t Asian women get the chance to embrace all parts of their humanity just like everyone else?” Because Wong centers her worldview in her special, Choy said, audiences get to see sex and other topics according to an Asian American woman, rather than through a white male lens. For a moment, Wong is able to disrupt the dynamics of power and privilege. “She moves us forward, because in her work and in the special, we see her perspective as the center of the universe, and we rarely see that,” Choy said. “It gives us the opportunity to ponder what would happen if my own perspective was at the center of the world. And what do I think?”In her own way, experts say, Wong also takes back the sexual agency that stereotypes have long denied Asian women, challenging Hollywood’s reductive depictions. “It’s basically a very direct and explicit example of an Asian American woman herself owning and embodying and verbalizing her sexuality unapologetically,” said Nadia Kim, a professor of Asian and Asian American Studies at Loyola Marymount University. Wong’s jokes are no social justice call to action, nor does she explicitly invoke race throughout, but experts emphasized that she doesn’t have to to be subversive. The prevailing Asian American female characters on screen have long fallen into two predominant, overly sexual categories, one of which is the submissive, demure, subservient exotic lotus blossom. Choy said the trope allows little room for Asian women to acknowledge their own pleasure in sexual activity, relegating the group to being obedient objects for men. And so Wong’s sexual assertiveness is profound, she said.“The power of Ali Wong is that so much of what she’s saying is recognizable. Women, Asian American women, have sexual desire, and there’s nothing wrong with that.” Choy said. “It could actually be something to be celebrated and discussed and poked fun at.” And dismantling the idea of the reductive, ultrasexual Asian woman doesn’t mean avoiding the topic of sex altogether, Ocampo said. “Somehow people think, ‘If I don’t talk about sex or if I act extra respectable then I will be treated like an equal,’ and that is not the case at all,” Ocampo said. “Respectability politics is a myth meant to keep marginalized people in line.” Ocampo said unapologetic, sex-loving depictions of Asian American aren’t the only ones that can be powerful and poignant. For the existing stereotypes to be disrupted, audiences need to see a variety of personalities, moods and identities, because ultimately that’s what reality looks like. “What kinds of images of Asian American women are helpful? Every possible image that can exist. I support Asian American women who embrace being nuanced, full characters, just like Ali Wong has,” Ocampo said. “They can be heroes, villains, sexual, chaste or all of the above at different moments of their lives. You know why? Because we are all these things at different moments of our lives.”"
23,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/-was-memes-subtle-asian-dating-sparked-unexpected-lasting-relationship-rcna15694,asian-america,"Like most casual Facebook users, 26-year-old Jenny Ly had joined  Subtle Asian Dating hoping to have fun and potentially meet new friends. Little did she know the online community would lead her to her boyfriend.Three years after it was launched and more than 650,000 members later, the Facebook group Subtle Asian Dating, a matchmaking platform for Asians around the world, has become a birthplace of marriages, engagements and a slew of long-term relationships. It emerged as a spinoff of a group founded in 2018 by a group of Australian teenagers, Subtle Asian Traits, which shot to popularity — with more than 2 million members as of this year — as a hub for memes and discourse about the Asian diaspora experience. Subtle Asian Dating is one of numerous spinoff groups adopting the “Subtle Asian” banner for interests ranging from dating to fashion to cooking.A friend of Ly’s had posted her in the group as an “auction”: the group's equivalent of a dating profile, often composed by a friend and offering a facetious list of pros and cons about the person being 'auctioned,' along with a set of photos.When 27-year-old Michael Dulay, who lived an hour away, found the post and messaged Ly on Instagram, the two started chatting platonically. But after a series of virtual Netflix hangouts and, eventually, Covid-cautious outdoor dates, an unexpected romance blossomed. The Southern California couple moved in together within six months of meeting online. Now, they’ve adopted a puppy.“We never expected anything to come from it. I was in it for the memes,” Ly said. “But with the right person, things just feel right … Michael proved to me that if someone really loved you, they would show it. I’ve never felt more myself in a relationship before than with Michael.”To Dulay, who said their love story had practically fallen into their laps, Ly serves as the ""North Star” inspiring him to become the best version of himself. A real relationship can burgeon from the group, he said, if users are genuine about their intentions from the start.Jenny Ly and Michael Dulay.Jenny Ly and Michael DulayPathik Gandhi, 30, was living in Chicago when he reached out to Iowa City-based Destinee Soubannarath Gwee, 28, after seeing her auctioned in the group. The two were hesitant to meet up during 2020, before Covid vaccines became available, but hourslong FaceTime dates convinced them it was worth preparing for a visit.The relationship moved quicker than either had expected: both met each other’s families within their first few in-person dates and, by last June, they were engaged.Living in a predominantly white area, Soubannarath Gwee said dating apps didn’t present a wide selection of Asian matches. But the global reach of Subtle Asian Dating enabled her to find Gandhi.“I just figured it’d be a good idea to just try it out and see what would happen,” she said. “I don’t know if I was expecting to literally find the person I was going to marry off of a Facebook group.”Destinee Soubannarath Gwee and Pathik Gandhi.Giulia VastaYet because the platform — and its related spinoff groups — includes hundreds of thousands of users from anywhere in the world, distance can also make it more difficult to form connections. That was a hurdle for 29-year-old Vy Ly and 27-year-old Patricia Poon, who lived 1,200 miles apart when they met on Subtle Queer Asian Dating+, a spinoff group of SAD.Ly was living in Las Vegas when she met Vancouver-based Poon at the end of 2018, and the two — who married in April last year — now live together in Los Angeles, a city both had long dreamed of moving to.Less than two months after they began talking online, the pair’s first disagreement forced them to confront how they felt about each other. When Poon worried Ly might be questioning the viability of a long-distance relationship, she “panicked” and booked the next available flight to Vegas to see Ly.“I took a day off work so I could extend the weekend, and I think I was probably there within 24 hours,” Poon said.The couple said they were fortunate to have been able to afford international flights every month, and then to both work remotely once the pandemic hit, which enabled them to move in together in Vegas.Both said the Facebook group served initially as respite for those who don’t live in a large queer community. Neither was expecting to find dates, let alone love. But Ly caught Poon’s attention when she introduced herself in the group in hopes of making friends.“I just found her post very endearing, a little dorky, very funny,” Poon said. “I was like, okay, let’s just send this pretty girl some memes and see what happens.”Patricia Poon and Vy Ly.Emily LauSome couples, like 21-year-old Winnie Chen and 26-year-old Oliver Cee, are still making long distance work. When they first met through SAD at the start of 2020, she was in Chicago while he was in Toronto. Still, they began talking — and within a month, Cee told Chen he wanted to take her on a date.“I thought he was joking because he lived all the way in Toronto. I was like, no way this is going to happen,” Chen said. “He said that he was serious, and I said, ‘OK, if you’re serious, then come over.’”So, come over he did: Cee took a couple of days off work and made the 12-hour drive. Despite her uncertainty about the distance, Chen said all her feelings and rationale convinced her to take a leap of faith.The pandemic’s initial international travel restrictions kept them apart for nearly a year, but now the two see each other during Chen’s school breaks. They have a plan, she said, for moving in together after her graduation and alternating between life in the United States and Canada.“[The distance] was hard, but I think the thing that kept us going was just being able to talk to each other, showing that we care about each other and being able to call every day,” Chen said. “I got really lucky. I know that’s not the case for a lot of people: I’m the only one out of all my Asian friends that was actually successful in finding a partner [through the group].""Oliver Cee and Winnie Chen.Oliver Cee and Winnie ChenDespite the drawbacks of such a large network, couples said one perk of Subtle Asian Dating is the ability to scope out others' views and values before deciding whether to start a conversation. Particularly active users are more likely to draw attention, whether through posting or commenting in the group, from potentially suitable matches.But like Subtle Asian Traits, Subtle Asian Dating and its spinoffs have received criticism for their emphasis on the East Asian experience. Groups like Subtle Curry Dating, self-titled by and targeted more specifically at South Asians, aim to help close the representation gap.Fatimah Sarwar, 22, had always imagined herself with a tall, curly-haired man with a “nice beard.” So when Arman Mridha, 23, slid into her Instagram DMs, Sarwar was floored: “I was just like, ‘Oh, my God!’ It felt like my Prince Charming.”She had auctioned off her friend on Subtle Curry Dating, but Mridha found himself wondering about the woman who made the post instead. “Not to be like Joe from ‘You,’” he said, but he knew he wanted to meet her.“I was just thinking, ‘Should I message her?’ And I kept thinking about it, but I ended up not doing it,” Mridha said. “And then one day I was at work and I was like, ‘You know what, I just can’t keep putting it off. I just got to do it.' So then I sent her this really long DM.”As Mridha tossed his phone aside and waited in anticipation, Sarwar was immediately struck by the sincerity of the message that had just popped up on her screen. That was January 2019. Last July, the two New York City residents became husband and wife.“First joining, I had no expectations. I just thought it would be a funny Facebook group that would eventually turn into just meme posting,” Mridha said. “I would always see other people posting their friends and I’d be like, ‘Wow, I wonder if anything happens.’ And then I saw her and I was like, ‘OK, let me try.’”Fatimah Sarwar and Arman Mridha.Jayma OrinOn the other side of the world in Australia, 27-year-old Bradley Prasad and 24-year-old Ranika Nath might have never run into each other despite living 15 minutes apart in Sydney. But Subtle Curry Dating brought them together one day in early 2020 as Prasad scrolled through Facebook on his way to work.He said Nath, who had just been auctioned on the group by a friend, stood out in the sea of posts. After reading her ""pros and cons"" list and realizing she was exactly who he was looking for, Prasad conjured up a witty opening and scored a dumpling date.The couple is now slated to wed in April.Ranika Nath and Bradley Prasad.Stuck in a Moment PhotographyThough putting oneself out there on a platform as public as Facebook can be intimidating, Prasad said, the rewards can be just as intense. With users scattered all around the globe, members never know when a conversation — whether with someone a continent away or right next door — might unfold into a happily-ever-after. “People will think, ‘Oh, is that a real relationship [if they met online]? They’re not going to last.’ But it works,” Prasad said. “We’re not the only couple that’s gone through this. It’s worked for lots of people, and it will keep working because we show that it works and people want what we have, which is good.”"
24,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/racism-linked-drinking-problems-asian-american-students-new-study-show-rcna18163,asian-america,"Racial discrimination may be causing alcohol-related problems among Asian American college students, according to a new research published in the Asian American Journal of Psychology.The study, which was conducted before the pandemic, surveyed more than 1,400 U.S.-born Asian students at a large Southern California public university with a predominantly Asian student body, and found that a majority of the participants reported experiencing racism and drinking to cope with their elevated levels of psychological distress. (The university was not named in the study.)“Asian American young adults are just generally overlooked in addiction science literature,” Derek Iwamoto, the lead author and an associate professor of psychology at the University of Maryland, told NBC Asian America. “We wanted to identify high-risk groups among Asian Americans.”The new study uses what is known as the everyday racial discrimination metric to measure students’ experience with racial discrimination (“being treated with less courtesy than others; receiving poorer service than others in restaurants or stores; people acting as if you are not smart”), and the Kessler psychological distress scale to assess the anxiety and depressive symptoms such treatment occasions. The Rutgers alcohol problems index​​ is used to measure alcohol-related problems.Among the study’s subjects, Iwamoto and his team found, racism has a strong effect on drinking. All students surveyed reported experiencing one incident of racism, and nearly two-thirds reported experiencing at least two. Many reported drinking to cope with the psychological distress caused by these negative experiences. (The sample pool was diverse, representing nine ethnicities and a variety of majors including the physical sciences, psychology, the humanities, education and engineering. Three in four participants are women.)“If someone is discriminated against,” he continued, “they’ll feel more psychological distress, which in turn can lead to alcohol-related problems.”Asian Americans have historically reported lower rates of alcohol abuse disorder than other racial cohorts, but advocates say the data obscures notable differences in drinking patterns between people of different ethnic and immigration backgrounds. U.S.-born Asians, for example, consume more alcohol on average than foreign-born Asians.From 2002 to 2019, the rate of alcohol abuse disorder among Asian American young adults across the country flatlined at about 10 percent, according to trend data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The rates for other racial groups, however, have steadily fallen. For Black Americans, the figure has dropped by half. During the Covid-19 pandemic, alcohol consumption among young adults spiked, said George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.  “One thing we can categorically say is that across all ethnic and racial groups, there’s been an increase in people drinking to cope with stress,” he said. “Racial discrimination definitely contributes to that.”Iwamoto noted some important limitations to his investigation. The everyday racial discrimination metric is not designed specifically to assess the particulars of the Asian American experience, so a more precise test may be needed to measure anti-Asian racism. And the number of students who reported experiencing racism may have been even higher had the study been conducted during the pandemic rather than before.The next step, he said, is more longitudinal studies into whether drinking to cope might cause long-term mental and physical health problems. This would require overcoming structural racism in health research: agencies like the National Institutes of Health have historically downplayed the social inequities that Asian American and Pacific Islanders face, feeding into the model minority trope. (Clinical research focused on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, the country’s fastest-growing racial group, comprised less than 0.2 percent of the NIH’s total budget, according to a 2019 study in JAMA Network Open.)“My ultimate goal is to look at drinking patterns and different types of discrimination over time,” he said. “If someone reports more alcohol-related problems over time, do they also report more sleeping problems or more depression over time?”In the meantime, he said, schools and public health leaders should focus on implementing anti-racism training and substance abuse interventions. “We need to do a better job at destigmatizing mental health problems and counseling,” he said, “and to have broader campaigns against Asian hate that bring more awareness about the types of discrimination that we face.”"
25,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/overlooked-unrecognized-exhibition-spotlights-asian-americans-fashion-rcna19231,asian-america,"A new exhibition at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City highlights the contributions — many of them unrecognized — of Asian Americans at all levels of the fashion industry, from garment factory workers to high-end designers.In doing so, “Asian Americans in New York Fashion: Design, Labor, Innovation” reflects the economic diversity of the Asian American community, which according to the Pew Research Center has the biggest wealth gap of any racial or ethnic group in the U.S.“The goal with fashion designers is to show the wide range in which Asian Americans approach design and show that not every Asian American will approach designing something the same way,” Maurizio Marrero, an FIT graduate student who helped organize the exhibition, told NBC Asian America. “With the topic of labor, we as a class felt like that topic was overlooked in exhibitions, and it’s something that we felt very strongly about including in the show.”The exhibition, which runs until March 27, was curated by FIT graduate students as a response to the rise of anti-Asian hate since the pandemic. ""Chinese Garment Workers at East Broadway Factory"" by Harvey Wang, New York City, circa 1983.Courtesy Harvey WangOne section of the exhibition is dedicated to labor. It features a video of garment workers on strike in 1982 in New York City’s Chinatown, where over 20,000 garment workers, most of whom were women of Asian descent, went on strike to protest what they considered unfair working conditions. The strike was a major victory for garment workers and a turning point for their union, which began working more closely with the Asian American women it represented.  “A lot of the time, labor sectors get overlooked when it comes to fashion and exhibits,” Sophia Daniel, another FIT graduate student who helped organize the exhibition, said. “Especially when it comes to communities that are working hard within their communities to promote workers’ rights, fair wages and working conditions, it’s important to highlight that and acknowledge the hard work that those people have done for future generations and themselves.”Another section displays materials about how Asian Americans in the fashion industry have promoted sustainability, innovation, minimalism and generational connections. Another shows different pieces from Asian designers, such as the Thai American designer Thakoon Panichgul and the duo Carol Lim and Humberto Leon of Opening Ceremony.One of the pieces on display is a 1997 brown jacket with gold sequins by Yeohlee Teng that features the designer’s label above another label with the name of the seamstress who sewed the garment, “Sue.” Highlighting both tags in the exhibit points to the invisibility garment workers faced in their work.Ruben Toledo, ""Tug of War Continues..."" illustration in Paper Magazine, December 1997. Courtesy Ruben ToledoA dress by Naeem Khan features an embroidered bodice, a key feature in his designs and an homage to his parents’ embroidery company in India. The exhibition concludes with a section displaying the wide range of prominent and lesser-known Asian designers from the last 60 years and their collections. A black denim jacket with bright green paint commissioned by designer Shail Upadhya “bridges fashion and art,” according to the exhibition’s brochure, while a green coat with brass buttons and horse details by designer Gemma Kahng “shows the contrasting role of mass-produced design in the New York fashion industry.”A strapless navy blue evening gown from the 1950s by designer Linda Kinoshita was a favorite among the graduate students, Daniel said. “It was just this really special piece and no one had ever heard of her. So we got to research her more and just confirm that there has been this impact and design from earlier years that has gone unrecognized.”"

Herman remembers wearing it for big tests in school, in class pictures and even while interviewing for colleges. “I was so proud she was wearing something so proudly Chinese,” Herman, a former professional dancer and video editor, told NBC Asian America. “We were proud of her then, and we’re still proud of her representing us as a people. We all still hold this flame after 20 years; we still stan her so hard.”The two-time Olympic medalist and five-time world champion holds a special place in the hearts of Asian American millennials who have continued to follow Kwan — one of the country’s most visible Asian Americans and President Joe Biden’s nominee to be ambassador to Belize — throughout her career. While Kwan has said she has no regrets about winning silver at the 1998 Winter Olympics after Tara Lipinski won the event, some members of her massive fan base are still not over the fact that she didn’t get the gold. "
27,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/74-asian-american-women-experienced-racism-year-new-report-says-rcna18626,asian-america,"As anti-Asian attacks on Asian American and Pacific Islanders continue to rise, a report released Thursday underscores how women in the racial group endure a disproportionate number of such incidents.The research, spearheaded by the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, revealed that 74 percent of Asian American and Pacific Islander women reported having personally experienced racism or discrimination in the last 12 months, roughly the time since the Atlanta-area spa shootings, in which eight people, most of them Asian women, were murdered, the report pointed out. Sung Yeon Choimorrow, the forum’s executive director, said it’s critical to recognize that many of the issues women in the community have had to confront can be traced back centuries. And they’ve persisted because of “systemic failures, systemic racism, that has lasted generations,” she said. “I want to emphasize that it is the women that are having more of the life-threatening type of dangerous encounters,” Choimorrow said. “We’re being targeted because of the stereotypes about us, that we won’t fight back, that we’re submissive.”Researchers surveyed more than 2,400 Asian American and Pacific Islander women online and over the phone across several languages, including English, Hindi, Korean, Mandarin, Tagalog and Vietnamese. Not only did a majority of women report racist encounters, but 38 percent also reported having experienced sexual harassment. And 12 percent said they experienced gender- or race-based physical violence. Russell Jeung, a co-founder of hate incident tracking forum Stop AAPI Hate, said many are likely to be dealing with the intersectional harassment of being both Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders and women. Men may also, in part, be less likely to report that they were bullied or harassed because of gender norms about masculinity; however, Jeung said, by and large, “it’s clearly a gendered issue” that affects women more. The report, which also breaks down data by ethnicity, found that women across Asian American and Pacific Islander subgroups face similar levels of racism and harassment, with 72 percent of East Asians, 73 percent of South Asians and 75 percent of Southeast Asians reporting that they’ve had such encounters. Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women reported the highest percentage, with 80 percent saying they’ve dealt with racism or discrimination. The group also reported significantly higher levels of sexual harassment, at more than 50 percent. Choimorrow said the results show that the danger that women across ethnicities in the community are in goes far beyond issues caused by racist “China virus” rhetoric and long predate the pandemic. It’s why, Choimorrow said, the solution isn’t as simple as passing hate crime legislation, like the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. “To be honest, if you think about it, having something like the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act also sort of reinforces that notion that this is a creation of Covid, and therefore we’re addressing it as that,” Choimorrow said. “There’s no recognition of what we have endured as people for hundreds of years. You’re not looking for the right solutions if you’re only looking at the context of the last two years.”Jeung also advocated for a shift away from hate crimes legislation. Less than 10 percent of incidents cataloged by Stop AAPI Hate are crimes for which people could be arrested, he said, and many of the issues that women and other groups face fall across a variety of racist incidents. The focus on crime and punishment won’t address all of them, he said. Moreover, while the impetus for some incidents is a hatred of Asian American and Pacific Islanders, others often involve race but aren’t necessarily motivated by racial animus. Rather than push for hate crime legislation, Jeung said, advocating for more expansive civil rights protections would be far more effective, with a large proportion of cases collected by the organization considered civil rights violations. He also said Stop AAPI Hate aims to get harassment recognized as a public health issue. “Racism harms the public health of both individuals and all communities. We’re asking the Department of Health to define harassment and to create awareness,” Jeung said. “We’re not going to go and arrest anybody for making a catcall or yelling or hurling an epithet. But identifying what’s a community norm, calling out for better practices, I think it’s important for society to do.” Groups are also recommending that the Biden administration invest in culturally competent and language-accessible services. Choimorrow said that too often, Asian American and Pacific Islanders are treated as a “special case,” with materials provided to the community only after tragedies or certain other events. But, particularly given the long-standing issues Asian women face, access to care is critical at all times. “The problem is when we’ve been invisibilized and dismissed as the ‘other.’ … In moments of crisis, you don’t have the bandwidth and the capacity to meet our needs, because you haven’t invested in it from the get-go,” Choimorrow said. “To me, that is a real issue.” "
28,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/no-longer-completely-invisible-new-book-explores-asian-american-pop-hi-rcna18368,asian-america,"In the half century since the passage of the 1965 Hart–Celler Act, Asians have become the fastest-growing racial group in the United States. Explosive population growth ushered in a dizzying level of representation in pop culture, from the global craze over boba and gochujang to Kamala Harris becoming the first Black and Asian American vice president. How did this all happen? How did this new generation of Asian Americans put themselves on the map? And how has this increased visibility in mainstream culture changed their sense of identity?""Rise.""HarperCollinsThese are the questions that Jeff Yang, Phil Yu and Philip Wang set out to answer in their new book, “RISE: A Pop History of Asian America from the Nineties to Now,” which hit the shelves Tuesday. A nearly 500-page collage of comics, essays and interviews, “RISE” is a homage to the seminal moments in sports, politics and entertainment that came to define contemporary Asian American culture.A buffet of offerings awaits the reader, from memorable character sketches of dot-com-era tech titans to an illustrated record of “yellowface” in films. Dozens of spreads on music track the rise of Asian Americans in rap, electronic dance music and hip-hop. Interspersed among them are sobering history pieces, such as an eyewitness account of Koreatown’s destruction during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Later chapters document the emergence of boba shops and viral meme groups like Subtle Asian Traits. The three authors each curated content for the decade they grew up in. Yang, a prolific columnist who launched the pioneering Asian American periodical A. Magazine, oversaw coverage of the 1990s. Yu, who helped steer the rise of Asian American blogs as the voice behind Angry Asian Man, put together the 2000s chapters. And Wang, a founding member of the filmmaking group Wong Fu Productions, capped off the 2010s. They also enlisted the help of more than 80 contributors, including Jeremy Lin, who reminisced about the legacy of “Linsanity,” and Jon M. Chu, who discussed the making of “Crazy Rich Asians.”Yang and Yu spoke with NBC Asian America about what their community has achieved in the past 30 years, and why it should be celebrated in these tumultuous times. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.NBC Asian America: “RISE” is described as a “scrapbook of voices, emotions, and memories from an era in which our culture was forged.” How did you come up with this idea?Yang: We started talking about the book in December 2019, when the very first signs were emerging that something bad was happening in the world. We recognized that something momentous and terrible was in danger of rolling back a lot of the incredible progress that we’ve made over the decades. In 2018, we were just coming off the triumph of ""Crazy Rich Asians"" that led us to believe a turning point had occurred in the pop culture firmament. And all of that felt very precarious. We realized that we needed to retrace our steps and create a blueprint for how we got here — to this point where Asian Americans are all of a sudden no longer completely invisible and finally able to tell our own stories. Nico Santos as Oliver and Michelle Yeoh as Eleanor in ""Crazy Rich Asians.""Sanja Bucko / Warner Bros. PicturesWhy focus on the last 30 years in the long arc of Asian American history?Yu: When ""Crazy Rich Asians"" came out in 2018, every article written about it had to mention the fact that it was the first major motion picture starring all Asian Americans in 25 years since ""Joy Luck Club."" While that’s true, there was a lot of culture making that happened in between that set the stage for all this. (They weren’t “watershed” moments in the mainstream, but they were little things that we clung onto — Dante Bosco as Rufio in “Hook,” was such an important character for a whole generation of Asian Americans.) We thought it would be fun to look back and be nostalgic about all this stuff that made up our culture and our community.Yang: When we use “pop” in the title, we really mean a “popular” history of Asian America, in the sense that it’s about how we lived, how we made community with one another, how we created a culture. The very term “Asian American” was popularized in 1968, when Asian American students chose to march in support of Black Panther Huey Newton under a banner that said “Asian America.” So those of us who came of age in the 1990s and 2000s and 2010s — we were the first generation to grow up with that term thrown at us all the time — and as a result, we had to find answers. What does it mean to be Asian American? Where are you really from?Why tell this story in such a visual format?Yu: From the outset, we were definitely interested in a multigenre book. It’s a more effective way of telling the story. It also allowed us to involve a lot of people in the making process, which is important because Jeff and Phillip and I are all East Asian, hetero men of a certain age. We understood we represent just one perspective under the very large, very diverse multiethnic umbrella term of “Asian American.” We wanted to make sure we covered more bases than what just these three guys could tell. You had to stop writing last November to meet print deadlines. Which intervening cultural moments would you have wanted to include in the book?Yang: I wish we had a chance to talk about Nathan Chen and Chloe Kim crushing it at the Olympics, and the conversations about identity that came out of it: “Can you be Asian American and ski for China without having to be called out and attacked with racist language?” There’s a lot of stuff that we had to leave out, but it makes us proud because it means there’s so much more story to tell, and our fears about being crushed under the weight of the pandemic and anti-Asian racism proved to not be true. We are a resilient and resourceful group and I think the future is still way ahead of us.The book opens with a dedication “to the ones who come next.” What do you hope younger readers will take away from “RISE”?Yang: There’s a section early on in the book that I put together with Shing Yin Khor, who’s a fantastic cartoonist. It’s a double-page spread simply called “Stuff Asians Like.” We literally just crowdsourced answers to this prompt: name something that’s not actually Asian but that Asians seem to gravitate toward and embrace. The answers we got were so hilarious and awesome. We got Hennessy and Ferrero Rocher, Kenny G and Celine Dion. McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish. And it shows that joining together in America and experiencing America together, in some ways, helps make us who we are as Asian Americans. This ongoing conversation about shared experiences — that is at the core of what it means to be Asian American.Yu: The punchline that holds “Stuff Asians Like” together actually is when someone reads it and goes, “Yes, Costco! That’s me.” That recognition is something that’s so important to the core of the book itself.

30,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/turning-red-cast-responds-controversial-review-pulled-offline-rcna19725,asian-america,"“Turning Red” cast members spoke up in support of the new Pixar film and its universality following a controversial review for the animated movie that was published by CinemaBlend. The review was pulled offline after being called “sexist,” “racist” and more by members of the press. CinemaBlend managing director Sean O’Connell wrote the review, saying that the film’s appeal was limited because it’s set in the Asian community of Toronto.“I recognized the humor in the film, but connected with none of it. By rooting ‘Turning Red’ very specifically in the Asian community of Toronto, the film legitimately feels like it was made for [director] Domee Shi’s friends and immediate family members,” O’Connell wrote in the since-pulled review. “Which is fine — but also, a tad limiting in its scope.”O’Connell doubled down on his opinion of the film in a since-deleted tweet that accompanied his review. The post read: “Some Pixar films are made for universal audiences. ‘Turning Red’ is not. The target audience for this one feels very specific and very narrow. If you are in it, this might work very well for you. I am not in it. This was exhausting.”“Turning Red” is directed by Domee Shi, who won an Oscar for animated short film with her Pixar offering “Bao.” The film tells the story of Meilin “Mei” Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang), a 13-year-old girl who finds herself turning into a giant red panda anytime she is overcome with emotion.Everything is going great for 13-year-old Mei — until she begins to “poof” into a giant panda when she gets too excited, featuring the voices of Rosalie Chiang, Ava Morse, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan and Hyein Park as Mei, Miriam, Priya and Abby.Pixar / DisneyWhen asked by the CBC if “Turning Red’s” storyline would limit its appeal as the review suggested, voice actor Chiang responded, “Of course not. This is a coming of age film, everyone goes through this change… I think different people of different cultures are going to go through it differently, but at the end of the day, the core messiness and change is something everyone can relate to.”Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, the breakout star of Netflix’s comedy series “Never Have I ever” who voices Mei’s friend in the film, also called the movie’s story “universal” in reacting to the pulled review. The actor added, “[Many people will be able] to relate to Meilin’s story, regardless of whether you are a young Chinese girl from Canada or not.”Domee Shi also disagreed with the review and told CBC, “[The film] is a love letter to that time of our lives. It’s a love letter to puberty. It’s a love letter to Toronto.”CinemaBlend announced Tuesday that the review was pulled from its website. CinemaBlend Editor-In-Chief Mack Rawden issued the following statement: “We failed to properly edit this review, and it never should have gone up. We have unpublished it and assigned to someone else. We have also added new levels of editorial oversight. Thank you to everyone who spoke up.”“Turning Red,” 13-year-old Mei Lee, a confident-but-dorky teenager with a tightknit group of friends who are passionate about a boy band called 4-Town.Pixar / DisneyO’Connell also issued the following apology on Twitter: “I’m genuinely sorry for my ‘Turning Red’ review. Thank you to everyone who has reached out with criticism, no matter how harsh. It is clear that I didn’t engage nearly enough with the movie, nor did I explain my point of view well, at all. I really appreciate your feedback.”Despite pulling the review, backlash against O’Connell and CinemaBlend continued. As Entertainment Weekly digital editor Yolanda Machado fired back on Twitter, “This [review] was written by your managing director, not some junior writer. As an editor, there is no amount of editing that would have erased the racism. What are you doing to make sure he is held accountable and this doesn’t happen again?”“Turning Red” debuts March 11 on Disney Plus."

This one happened to make headlines, she said, because it occurred so publicly at a news conference.An “ABC World News Tonight” broadcast last month misidentified New York City community organizer Grace Lee as Michelle Go, an Asian American woman who was pushed in front of a subway train in January, in its coverage of a vigil for Christina Yuna Lee, another Asian American woman who was killed in her apartment.An ABC spokesperson said the network realized the mistake immediately and corrected it before the show aired anywhere else. In a statement to the Asian American Journalists Association, it said the misidentification was an “unfortunate technical error, not one born from insensitivity.”During its coverage of this year’s Super Bowl, NBC also misidentified the country singer Mickey Guyton as the R&B singer Jhené Aiko during a preshow performance. NBC Sports apologized on Twitter and didn’t respond to requests for further comment. NBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC News, NBC Asian America and NBC Sports. “Every time that happens, it’s not intentional. Or I assume it’s not intentional,” Huang said of her misidentification experiences. “But it does make me think that, often, we are not perceived to be as valuable as individual leaders.”Simple errors like those usually occur without malice, experts say. But Asian Americans are familiar with a painful history of exclusion in the U.S. that has repeatedly stripped them of their individuality, and many see a pattern in the ignorance that enables such mistakes to occur so frequently today.Although Asian communities have populated the country since the 1800s, public hostility pushed them, as well as other non-Asian ethnic groups, to form cultural enclaves like Chinatowns. Legislation throughout the latter half of the 19th century, such as the Page Act and the Chinese Exclusion Act, further stereotyped Chinese people into a single category.Asian immigrants initially were portrayed as cheap, dispensable labor. As more arrived in the country, caricatures associated with the “Yellow Peril” depicted them as a threat to the West.The inability to separate Asian people from their races and perceived nationalities then grew starker as the U.S. entered wars against Asian countries. From the incarceration of Japanese Americans without trial during World War II to the lumping together of various Asian ethnicities during the Korean and Vietnam wars, experts said, such conflicts contributed to the homogenization of Asian Americans.“Americans were able to separate Nazis from Germans, whereas many Americans weren’t able were able to separate Vietnamese communists from the Vietnamese in general,” said Scott Wong, a professor of Asian American history at Williams College. “Or they couldn’t make the distinction between soldiers in Japan and Japanese Americans. You had to almost show an allegiance to Hitler or Mussolini for you to be interned during the Second World War if you’re German or Italian.”While that phenomenon might sometimes be attributed to the cross-race effect — the tendency for people of all races to more easily recognize faces of their own race — Wong said its prevalence when applied to Asian Americans is rooted in that perpetual foreignization throughout U.S. history.“Many Americans, for the longest time, did not grow up seeing Asian people,” Wong said. “It’s not an excuse now, because there’s a lot of Asians in the country, but it’s a legacy of exclusion and then segregation.”People today probably aren’t conscious of that context when they mistake one Asian person for another, Wong said. While there’s “nothing malicious” about such incidents now, he said, they are a product of habitual American negligence in learning to distinguish between different Asian people and groups.Ever since the civil rights activist Mia Ives-Rublee gained national prominence for her work in disability justice, she began seeing herself tagged on social media as one of several other Asian American women in the field. The same happens to them in return, she said.Mia Ives-Rublee.Courtesy Mia Ives-RubleeSuch mistakes occur so frequently that when someone requested her for a speaking engagement, Ives-Rublee wasn’t sure whether they’d reached out to the right person. She said the constant instances of mistaken identity have made her feel almost like a fraud.“It’s just been a frustrating experience, particularly when we hit a certain milestone and get mistaken for somebody else,” she said. “It just takes some of the joy out of the hard work that we put in. Like, is my work making the impact that I think it is if people can’t even tell the difference between me and other people?”DongWon Song, a literary agent based in New York City, said they get mistaken for one of a handful of prominent Asian American literary agents at least once during every professional conference they attend, even though they often are of other nationalities and have distinctly different physical traits.DongWon Song.Courtesy DongWon Song“It just felt very racially charged as a result,” said Song, who uses “they/them” pronouns. “I think people misunderstand the term ‘microaggression’ in a lot of ways, because the ‘micro’ doesn’t apply to the impact.”Regardless of intent, they said, instances like those can feel just as dehumanizing as more overtly racist aggressions: It becomes clear that the perpetrator is upholding an internal projection of who they are rather than engaging with them as an individual.“It’s going to sound like a big leap, but all those tiny little moments are what make it possible for someone to push someone on the subway tracks without thinking of them as a person or to attack a lady in the street,” Song said. “Until people realize they are complicit in that exact same system, whether it’s making fun of my name or getting my pronouns wrong or thinking I’m literally another person, all those things are designed to remove my humanity and agency in a way that enables violence.”Such honest mistakes are part of a longstanding pattern of violence against Asian Americans. When two men murdered Vincent Chin in Michigan in 1982, they were looking to take out their anger against the Japanese car industry. Chin, a Chinese American man, became the target of a hate crime against an ethnic group he didn’t belong to.Lok Siu, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in Asian diaspora studies, said racist characterizations have repeatedly linked Asian Americans through similar stereotypes and that people view and understand Asian Americans only through those lenses when they don’t make efforts to familiarize themselves with other ethnic groups.“So you have these different moments of mistaken identities for particular targeted groups that were really just mistakes,” Siu said. “But they’re mistakes that they don’t care about, because it’s not about the people they’re attacking. It’s really about expressing their rage against a group or against somebody.”Just as health officials in the late 1800s falsely linked Chinatowns to the spread of disease by blaming Chinese Americans for smallpox and cholera outbreaks, Chinese Americans in 2020 once again became scapegoats for the Covid-19 pandemic.And against the background of tense U.S. relations with China, Siu said, recent government targeting of Chinese scientists is another modern-day manifestation of fear born from the inability to recognize the individuality of Asian Americans.When all members of a diverse race of people are viewed as one, one ethnic group’s being targeted can mean any ethnic group’s being targeted. The violence against Asian Americans, particularly East Asians, as a result of recent anti-China discourse isn’t surprising, Siu said, because it’s a product of the same phenomenon that has plagued those communities for nearly two centuries.“It’s not a one-off. It’s not anomalous. It’s part of a historical process,” Siu said. “And you see this emerging again in this moment, but you see the same thing.”"
32,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/federal-judge-rules-new-admissions-policies-elite-school-discriminate-rcna18291,asian-america,"A federal judge ruled Friday that a Virginia school system illegally discriminated against Asian Americans when it overhauled the admissions policies at an elite public school.The ruling from U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton found that impermissible “racial balancing” was at the core of the plan to overhaul admissions to Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, known as “TJ.” The school routinely ranks as the best or one of the best public schools in the country, and slots at the school are highly competitive.In 2020, the Fairfax County School Board significantly revamped the admissions process at the school. A standardized test that had been a linchpin of the admissions process was scrapped in favor of a system that set aside equal numbers of TJ slots at each of the county’s middle schools, among other changes.Hilton, in his ruling, wrote, “The discussion of admissions changes was infected with talk of racial balancing from its inception.”Although the school has enjoyed a stellar academic reputation for decades, Black and Hispanic students were woefully underrepresented in the student body.TJ’s current freshman class, the first to be accepted under the new policies, reflected a significant change in racial makeup. Asian representation decreased from 73% to 54%. The percentage of Black students increased from 1% last year to 7%. Hispanic representation increased from 3% to 11%.The school system insisted its new admissions policies are race-neutral; among other things, they noted that the panelists who evaluate applications don’t even know the race of the students they are evaluating.The school system also argued that efforts to increase Black and Hispanic representation are legally permissible as long as the school board had not demonstrated a desire to harm Asian Americans.John Foster, a lawyer for the school system, said the school board will consider an appeal of Hilton’s ruling.“The new process is blind to race, gender and national origin and gives the most talented students from every middle school a seat at TJ,” Foster said in a written statement.Hilton, though, said the backdrop under which the school board acted showed that racial considerations were first and foremost on the mind. He noted that the death of George Floyd in May 2020 prompted calls for racial justice across the country. He also noted that the Virginia General Assembly and Department of Education were pushing schools like TJ — known as “Governor’s Schools” in Virginia — to develop plans to quickly address the lack of Black and Hispanic students.“Throughout this process, Board members and high-level FCPS officials expressed their desire to remake TJ admissions because they were dissatisfied with the racial composition of the school,” Hilton wrote.The Coalition for TJ, the group of parents who challenged the admissions process in court with help from the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, said in a statement that it “is thrilled by Judge Claude Hilton’s clear renunciation of racism and discrimination and his powerful defense of equality.”Hilton’s ruling comes roughly a month after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a similar case filed by Asian American families against Harvard University over its admissions policies."

The man was said to have continued to taunt Wong before he cried out, “I can’t breathe!”Prosecutors quoted Wong as saying he didn't care ""if you can breathe or not"" before he punched the man's face.Prosecutors had asked for 60 days in jail, calling Wong a repeat offender.In the first case, Wong and two other officers took a suspect to a holding cell in Harlem on Oct. 4, 2019, when the man kicked the cell door and spit at the officers, officials said.Wong then punched the man in the face, leading to his being taken to a hospital, where he was treated for a laceration above his right eye, which required stitches, officials said. At Wong’s sentencing, also on Wednesday, state Supreme Court Judge Curtis Farber ordered him to serve two years of probation, undergo anger management counseling and perform 70 hours of community service, officials said. Supreme Court is the top criminal court in New York.Wong is still employed by the police department but is in a disciplinary process that could lead to his firing, a spokeswoman for the district attorney said. The police department would confirm only that Wong is employed and on modified duty.Wong's attorney and a representative for the Sergeants Benevolent Association could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday.“Law enforcement officials are sworn to serve and protect their communities, including New Yorkers in their custody,” Bragg said. “In this case, Sergeant Wong violated not only his oath — but the law — during the violent arrests of two New Yorkers, on two separate occasions. ""Our Office will continue to investigate and prosecute police violence, and we encourage any victims or witnesses of similar conduct to report it to our Police Accountability Unit."" "
34,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/-batman-criticized-scene-attempted-subway-attack-asian-victim-rcna19034,asian-america,"Asian Americans are raising concerns over a scene in the new movie “The Batman,” which premiered nationwide Friday, depicting a group of men following an Asian man off the subway with the intent of physically assaulting him.The scene occurs within the first 10 minutes of the three-hour film, when Batman interrupts the attack and beats up the assailants, telling them that he is “vengeance.” This saves the Asian man, who appears fearful of Batman as well. Critics on Twitter are calling the scene “triggering” and insensitive to Asian Americans during a time of increased violence against the community, regardless of whether the attack was intended as racially motivated.Some are tweeting content warnings about the scene to Asian Americans planning to see it in theaters, and several people on social media are questioning whether the depiction was an oversight or meant to be a commentary about the prominence of hate crimes against Asian Americans during the pandemic.The movie was primarily filmed between January 2020 and March 2021, according to IMDB, spanning much of the spike in anti-Asian hate. Criticism of the scene comes in the wake of the high-profile death of Michelle Go, who was fatally pushed in front of a New York City subway train in January.Warner Bros. Pictures, the film production company behind “The Batman,” did not respond to requests for comment.Amid the backlash, some say they are grateful the movie depicts Batman putting a stop to such an attack.David Chen, who hosts “Culturally Relevant,” a podcast featuring film and television reviews, tweeted that the scene was an ill-considered use of triggering imagery that would otherwise be acceptable if used constructively.Underneath his thread, users criticized the attack as seemingly the only form of Asian representation in the film. Others viewed Batman’s response as heroic, or as highlighting the lack of police protection for Asian Americans when incidents like these happen.But in critiquing the scene on Twitter, Chen argued that depicting such loaded imagery without making a larger point about the meaning behind it is still disrespectful.“To me, this was an irresponsible and inflammatory use of this imagery that (knowingly or unthinkingly) gestured at real life horrific events,” he tweeted. “It felt thoughtless [to] me and was triggering to many AAPI folks I’ve discussed the film with,” he wrote, referring to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders."
35,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/ida-new-york-ag-calls-language-access-severe-weather-alerts-rcna18193,asian-america,"New York officials are calling for a wider array of language options in severe weather alerts after Hurricane Ida’s floods disproportionately claimed Asian lives and devastated lower-income immigrant neighborhoods in September. State Attorney General Letitia James sent a letter Tuesday calling on the National Weather Service and the U.S. commerce secretary to expand emergency alert language beyond just English and Spanish. In the letter, she cited the alerts that were sent out ahead of Ida’s “catastrophic” rain, urging residents to find higher ground in preparation for the life-threatening flooding.But she said the messages didn’t reach those who needed them the most. “The storm caused 18 deaths in New York, and the majority of those individuals were of Asian descent and did not speak or had limited proficiency in English or Spanish,” her office said in a news release. James’ letter cited reporting by NBC Asian America documenting Ida’s impact on Asian neighborhoods in the city, where families drowned in their basement apartments. She urged the weather service to make translations available in all the languages spoken by members of a region where a given severe weather event will happen. In New York City, she said, that would be Chinese, Russian, French Creole, Bengali and Korean, as well as Spanish.“The Service has recognized that the failure to issue alerts in Spanish when it is commonly spoken in the impacted area has contributed to tragic loss of life,” she wrote, adding, “Hurricane Ida struck more than seven years after these critical recommendations, yet the Service’s alerts were not distributed in several languages commonly spoken in the impacted areas in New York City.”Residents clear debris and damaged belongings from their homes in Queens, N.Y., on Sept. 3.Mark Lennihan / AP fileThe letter was endorsed by a variety of city and state officials, including U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, state Sen. John Liu, State Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou and New York City Council members Linda Lee, Sandra Ung and Julie Won.“It is sad that a loss of life is what it takes in order for key weather service updates to be available to non-English speaking New York City communities,” Meng said in the release. Nearly a quarter of Asian American immigrants live in poverty, and an estimated 13 percent are undocumented, city data show. And experts say even those statistics are underestimates. Queens neighborhoods affected by the flooding relied on local organizers and neighbors to help with translation efforts when it came to distributing food and providing shelter to victims. The day after the storm, nearly 500 people contacted Myoungmi Kim, the executive vice president of the Queens-based nonprofit group Korean Community Services of Metropolitan New York, or KCS. Although government assistance was available, she has said, it was difficult to navigate, especially because it was offered only in English. “The day after the storm, so many people wanted to talk to me because of the KCS emergency fund distribution. But they couldn’t speak because of their crying,” Kim said in October. “They just cried and kept crying and crying because they had lost everything.”James said it’s clear that offering disaster alerts and services in more languages saves lives. With climate change, it will only become increasingly necessary, she wrote. “As federal, state and local governments confront increasingly extreme weather tied to climate change, the Service plays a critical role in providing Americans with potentially life-saving warnings,” she said. “Fortunately, the widespread use of cellular and internet technology, in addition to the array of television broadcasts, including those in foreign languages, makes it possible for the Service to instantaneously reach more Americans in harm’s way than ever before.”"
36,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/unexpected-way-love-blind-groundbreaking-rcna19593,asian-america,"In one episode of “Love Is Blind,” the Netflix reality dating show in which people get engaged sight unseen, contestant Natalie Lee speaks to her father, Don, just before her wedding ceremony. “Of all the things I’ve done in my life,” Don says, beaming at his daughter, “being your dad is my greatest achievement ever.”The moment is striking, not only because it’s a reprieve from a rather criticized, chaotic second season that concluded last week but also because it’s a sharp departure from the stale image of expressionless, strict Asian parents the media has often been criticized for portraying. But Don’s singular representation of parenting alone isn’t what makes the show’s depictions of Asian immigrant parents groundbreaking. The range of personalities exhibited by several of the parents of Asian cast members allow for a more nuanced understanding of parenting, simultaneously challenging viewers to look at parental love outside squarely Western forms of affection, experts said. And it’s critical, because good parenting does not exist solely within the confines of the white sitcom family. “You need consistent depictions of authenticity and to have varying types of authenticity because we’re not all the same either,” Ana-Christina Ramón, director of research and civic engagement in the division of social sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles, told NBC Asian America.Natalie Lee, right, in season 2 of Love Is Blind.NetflixAfter dating and becoming engaged sight unseen, cast members then move into apartments and settle into their regular lives, weathering the typical challenges of dating, including the art of gaining parents’ approval. In addition to Lee, two other Asian Americans on the show, Abhishek “Shake” Chatterjee and Deepti Vempati, both of Indian descent and engaged to each other, also took part in ceremoniously meeting the parents, who show varying degrees of concern and warmth. Don sticks out as the ride-or-die proud dad on the show, who appears to  accept Lee’s fiance, Shayne, immediately without question. The act of instantaneous acceptance likely aligns more with what many perceive to be parental love in the Western sense, said Stephanie  Chan, associate professor of sociology at Biola University in California. Experts said that this style of parenting, associated with more verbal affirmations of care, is often fully accepted as the most conventional example of love. But Lee’s mother, Nan, who’s eventually won over, is at first visibly concerned and perhaps a bit disappointed about the swift, reality show engagement. The contrasting reactions, said Anthony Ocampo, a sociology professor at California State Polytechnic University, are both forms of parental affection, though they may seem at odds with one another. “From her mom’s point of view, her skepticism didn’t seem like it was about not approving or not trusting her daughter’s choices. I think, deep down, she just doesn’t want her to get hurt,” Ocampo said. “Whereas with Natalie’s dad, his way of showing love is to accept the choices she makes without judgment.”Abhishek Chatterjee, center, in season two of ""Love Is Blind.""NetflixWhen it comes to meeting Chatterjee’s family, his mother, Sita, is forthright, refusing to take his side after he reveals that he felt no physical attraction to Vempati. She underscores how Vempati could easily find someone who loves her ""the way she is.""“Being very frank, I’m very much identifying with her right now more than you,” Sita declares, before telling her son that Vempati “doesn’t deserve someone who gives her even half a percent less.” Though Asian parents are often cast as overly worried about optics, the scene shows empathy. “I’m sure that Shake’s mom, as a woman, knows what it’s like to be dismissed based purely on looks, and she was like, ‘Nope, this may be my son, but I’m gonna let him know he can’t treat women like that and feel OK about it,'"" Ocampo said.At the end of the series, Vempati’s mother, GV, gives viewers one last emotional glimpse at another profoundly moving relationship after her daughter declares at the altar, before families and friends, that instead of marrying Chatterjee she has chosen herself. Through tears, GV tells Vempati that she’s proud. It’s a pure example of unconditional love, Ocampo said, and Vempati's emotional well-being took precedence. The media has given the impression that good parenting is done through a largely white, Western lens, even though those ideas are the minority, globally, Ramón said. “Growing up watching '80s and '90s sitcoms of white families like on ‘Full House’ or ‘Growing Pains,’ there was a particular way that you saw white parents show love,” Ocampo echoed. “They talked to their kids like they were friends, hugging them all the time, or saying ‘I love you’ all the time. Those models sometimes give people the impression that that’s the only way a parent can show love.” And other families of color are often multiracial or “raceless,” with the cultural aspects scrubbed from the family unit. “Hollywood thinks, ‘Oh, let’s make this universal.’ And by eliminating cultural references, they really make it more of a default whiteness. They’re representing that you can just plug in anybody,” Ramón added. While Asian immigrant parents are never as extreme or one-dimensional as the trope viewers see on screen, their method of discipline has been wrongly interpreted as disregard for their child's emotional well-being. Oftentimes immigrant parents, having dealt with racism upon arriving to the U.S., or discrimination in their workplaces, bring those experiences into their parenting styles. Ocampo said many recognize that their own children are not on the “same playing field as the ‘American’ aka white kids,” and may stress that they need to work twice as hard to compete. “Asian immigrant parents know that the decision to come to the United States is a huge risk, and so the success of their American-born children is proof to their families and loved ones back home that the risk was worth it,” Ocampo said. “That the sacrifices they endured were worth it.” And while some kids of immigrants may interpret criticism and honesty as lack of approval, Chan said that in many cases it’s a reflection of the closeness Asian parents feel toward their kids, and a form of guidance that others cannot provide in a way a true friend would.One reason that “Love Is Blind” was able to provide more dimension, Ramón suspects, is that it was a reality show. It could  to depict the actual behaviors of Asian immigrant parents in a way that white writers and producers, who might construct what they think is an accurate portrayal, may not be able to. “This is how real people are,” Ramón said. "
37,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/senate-committee-split-japanese-american-judicial-nominee-rcna19710,asian-america,"A U.S. Senate panel on Thursday voted in favor of advancing five of President Joe Biden’s district court picks but deadlocked on one who had faced Republican questions about her views on racial discrimination and affirmative action.The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee split 11-11 on whether to endorse U.S. Magistrate Judge Kenly Kiya Kato’s nomination to become the first Japanese-American woman to serve as a federal district court judge in the Central District of California.The panel’s divided vote means the Senate must first vote to discharge her nomination from the committee before any consideration of her nomination by the full Senate can begin.Democrats had praised Kato’s experience a former public defender at her Feb. 1 nomination hearing and said her appointment would further the Biden administration’s efforts to diversify the federal bench.But Republicans at that hearing pressed Kato on her views about discrimination after zeroing in on a book review she co-wrote as a student at Harvard Law School that said neo-conservative Asian-Americans internalize “the dialogue of oppressors.”Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said the book review conveyed that “to be sufficiently woke, an Asian American must support policies that discriminate against Asian Americans.”He noted Harvard, her law school alma mater, was facing a lawsuit now before the U.S. Supreme Court alleging it discriminated against Asian-American undergraduate applicants through race-conscious admissions processes aimed at boosting diversity.“Does that practice concern you?” Cruz asked.Kato declined to discuss the case, a challenge to affirmative action on college campuses, noting it is pending.Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the panel’s ranking Republican, on Thursday said he was “disappointed she wouldn’t answer whether she thought racial discrimination was wrong.”Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii called those questions “uncalled for” while noting Kato’s parents were detained as children in internment camps with other Japanese Americans during World War II.“Of course she understands how terrible racial discrimination is,” Hirono said.The panel, meanwhile, voted 12-10 to advance Nina Morrison, a lawyer at the Innocence Project whose career has focused on exonerating people, who is nominated to be a federal judge in Brooklyn.The panel also advanced Jennifer Rochon, the Girl Scouts of the United States of America’s general counsel nominated to be a Manhattan federal judge, and Trina Thompson, a California state court judge picked for the Northern District of California.For the Central District of California, the panel also advanced Sunshine Sykes and Sherilyn Garnett, both state court judges currently."

40,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/several-asian-nyu-students-assaulted-campus-last-month-rcna18738,asian-america,"Asian students at New York University say they are on edge after a string of assaults were reported over the last month. A spokesperson for the school described four separate attacks in February in which students were suddenly assaulted on streets near the Washington Square Park campus. Three of the four victims were Asian, said NYU spokesperson John Beckman. One of them, senior AJ Sun, told NBC Asian America that while walking on campus on Feb. 15, a white male punched him in the side of the head and fled. The attack left him rattled, and Sun said that he doesn’t feel the same sense of safety walking around campus anymore. “Any Asian student walking on campus is still in danger of random, sporadic and yet detrimental hate-infused attacks,” he said. The attacks on NYU students, first reported by the campus newspaper Washington Square News, preceded a spree of assaults Sunday on seven Asian women in Manhattan. Steven Zajonc, 28, was arrested Wednesday and charged with seven counts each of assault as a hate crime, attempted assault as a hate crime, aggravated harassment and harassment, police told NBC News earlier this week.NYU’s Campus Safety Department reported the incidents to the NYPD and is operating under the assumption that the three attacks  on Asian students were motivated by racism and are connected in some way, but Beckman says it’s not a certainty. “We want these incidents to end immediately,” Fountain Walker, vice president for NYU Global Campus Safety, said in an email to the student body this week. “We are conscious of the unease that Asian members of the NYU community may be feeling right now; we stand united in full support of them, and want them to know they have our support and that we are determined to make them feel secure on our campus.""The university has plans to increase campus security patrols, and add better lighting and more cameras around Washington Square Park.Sun said he takes issue with the way Campus Safety officers initially handled the report of his assault. In the days following the attack, he said NYU took no action besides documenting what happened. “No representative from NYU has reached out to me asking how I am feeling physically and emotionally after suffering from this horrific hate crime assault,” he said. “How little effort NYU put in supporting and giving us support made me very disappointed.”After Sun made the issue public with a series of Instagram posts, he said NYU’s attention to the problem improved. Since then, he’s been able to connect with some of the other victims and meet with school administrators. But the violence has persisted since his attack, he said, and it has left community members shaken. “I understand that it’s a slow and long process to change the system,” he said. “But the fact that this suspect is still committing crimes in the middle of campus, and any student can become a possible victim is not letting us feel safe to walk on campus anymore.”Walker noted in his email to students that Campus Safety has been instructed to take similar incidents seriously.“We have reinforced with Campus Safety Officers the importance of treating reports of students being struck — or any other matter — with the utmost seriousness, promptness, respect, and concern,” Walker wrote. "
41,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/family-froze-death-crossing-us-foot-shows-realities-south-asian-immigr-rcna14627,asian-america,"In the small village of Dingucha, in the state of Gujarat in western India, flyers are plastered on lampposts and buildings, hard to miss even on a short walk down the road. They advertise to the residents, most of whom live in poverty, a better life abroad. “Study in UK, Canada, Free Application, Offer Letter In 3 Days.”The promise might sound too good to be true, but those who live there say many of their dreams revolve around it. “If there is money, they will go,” Ganpatbhai Patel, a resident of Dingucha, told NBC News in a translated interview.Last month, a family took up that offer, as many had before. Jagdish Patel, 39, Vaishaliben Patel, 37, and their children, Vihangi, 11, and Dharmik, 3, left their home in Dingucha and set out for Canada. About a week later, their bodies were found 13 yards from the border, where they had froze to death trying to cross into the U.S. on foot. “The U.S. holds kind of an allure or prominence,” said Pawan Dhingra, a professor of American studies at Amherst College. “There’s been a lot of success here by South Asians. … It becomes a place that seems more promising.” The story of the PatelsLike many in Dingucha, Jagdish Patel worked in a factory. He made 9,000 rupees, roughly $120, a month for his family of four. His wife stayed home with the children, but neighbors say she dreamed of working in a beauty salon in the U.S. It’s a story that experts say is barely on peoples’ radar. A lower-income, South Asian family crossing over the U.S.’s northern border seems to violate many tropes that define how Americans think about immigration, according to Dhingra. “There’s definitely a dominant image of South Asians in the U.S. as coming on student visas or work visas, finding education and employment, oftentimes in white-collar positions,” he said. But that doesn’t paint a completely accurate picture, he said. And for those who don’t have a school or company to sponsor their entry, the journey isn’t as straightforward. In Dingucha, where a neighbor of Jagdish Patel told reporters that he earns only $134 per month for a household of five, families weigh the pros and cons of getting to the West by different means. Relatives of the Patel family mourn their deaths in Dingucha village in the western state of Gujarat, India, on Jan. 28. Amit Dave / Reuters“They are usually people above 30 who do not earn well in India and don’t see a good future for themselves and their families,” Janvi Sonaiya, a reporter with the Gujarat-based publication Vibes of India, told NBC Asian America. “They have met and seen several people like them who have come back to India after a decade and a half and talking about the quality of life and the bright future their children have.”It’s a collectively recognized norm in the village that seems to be etched in ink for every resident to see. Success doesn’t come in Dingucha, Sonaiya said. It’s more likely to find those who leave it.“When you walk in the streets of the village, you see no advertisements of food or grocery products,” she said. “All you see are ads of U.S. and Canada visas — most of them even mention that visas will be provided without exams.”Family and friends of the Patels told Sonaiya that Jagdish was struggling. He wanted a better education for his kids, as well as better job opportunities and higher pay for himself and his wife, none of which he felt he could find in India. Jagdish and Vaishaliben hardly told anyone where they were going. Ganpatbhai Patel, who lived near them, said that he only learned of their journey to Canada when news broke that they had died. Though many details of their journey are still unclear, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told NBC News the family flew into Toronto on Jan. 12 and then made their way to Manitoba. About a week later, they were dropped off in Emerson, a border town just north of Minnesota and North Dakota. Their bodies were found on Jan. 19 after a blizzard apparently separated them from their group, other Indian nationals and a Florida man, Steve Shand. The others made it across the border and were apprehended by U.S. border officials. Shand was arrested and charged with the transport or attempted transport of illegal immigrants. His lawyers did not return NBC News’ request for comment. When childcare items like diapers and toys were found with the remaining travelers, they revealed to authorities that four people who were traveling with them were missing. Some of the Indian migrants also told authorities that the group had been walking for no less than 11 hours.Flying the bodies back for a funeral would have been too expensive, Dingucha community members told NBC News, so a cremation was held in Canada. Jagdish Patel’s brother answered a phone call, but hung up when asked about the deaths.Despite the way the tragedy has shocked the village, Ganpatbhai said he doesn’t think it will deter people. “If a man neither goes to the U.S. nor has any relatives there, then there is a faint chance that he will even get a bride,” another resident told Vibes of India, whose reporters spent time in Dingucha.Investigators say human smuggling played a role, and Canada, the U.S. and India are working in tandem to identify the larger network involved. Indian police arrested several travel agents in Gujarat in connection with the Patels’ deaths. The details remain unclear, but that doesn’t matter to those desperate to escape, experts say.  “Every migrant makes an economic calculation around making a very perilous journey to come to the U.S.,” said Lakshmi Sridaran, executive director of South Asian Americans Leading Together, a civil rights organization. An immigrant story that’s never toldThe socioeconomic needs that drive a family like the Patels to embark on a treacherous journey abroad often follow them wherever they go. With South Asian populations growing in the U.S. and Canada, scholars say the homogeneity with which institutions view the community is harmful. “The most marginalized are continually left out of those dominant narratives,” said Sruti Suryanarayanan, SAALT’s community and learning manager. “When it comes to talking about working-class folks, when it comes to talking about Dalit folks, people who are refugees, people who are undocumented … there are so many different reasons for people to seek residency in the U.S.”If the Patels had crossed over into the U.S. and been detained like the rest of their group, they would have faced hostile conditions,  said Sridaran and Suryanarayanan, who partner with immigration justice activists on the northern border. Besides migrating to pursue a better life, many South Asians are fleeing social persecution because of caste, faith or gender.“If they do state political repression, religious repression, any of these things, they’re almost categorically denied asylum,” Sridaran said. “There’s nonexistent language access, denial of religious accommodations, the use of solitary confinement and gross medical neglect.” On top of what they face in the detention centers, South Asians who come into the U.S. face a political system with no knowledge of the specific oppressions they might have faced back home.“Judges don’t have a full, nuanced understanding of the sociopolitical tensions that are present in various communities,” Suryanarayanan said. “Why it’s different to be Dalit in Sri Lanka and in Afghanistan, and how those intersections affect people as they migrate.”Through their civil rights work and the data SAALT collects, Sridaran and Suryanarayanan know that even when lower-income South Asians make it to the U.S., their barriers often follow them. Bengali and Indo-Caribbean neighborhoods in New York City have high rates of poverty, food insecurity and a lack of language access. India alone has at least 550,000 undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., among the highest nationalities, according to the Migration Policy Institute.“South Asians are a really heterogenous group,” Dhingra said. “There’s a dominant image for a reason, but it overlooks the fact that a lot of South Asian immigrants are in poverty. They’re in the top 10 most undocumented groups in the country.” It takes a certain amount of privilege to travel overseas at all, Dhingra said, and the poorest in a given country usually don’t leave. But for working-class folks who don’t see a future for themselves at home, there is no accessible straightforward way of getting out. “There’s a demand being created to migrate to the U.S., but not a means that’s available to them that is safe,” Sridaran said."

The two men got into an argument, and the second man is alleged to have pulled out a hammer and hit the victim once in the head before fleeing.“We are grateful for the outstanding police work by the NYPD who were able to locate and arrest the person who attacked one of our riders within 24 of the incident,"" Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said in a statement. ""We will always stand up for our customers and their safety, and we expect this perpetrator of a hate crime will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" he said.The attack comes weeks after Mayor Eric Adams and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul unveiled a plan to combat violence on public transit. Adams and Hochul said in their announcement that the plan would address public safety concerns and support people who are experiencing homelessness and serious mental illness on city subways while also cracking down on subway riders who display aggressive behavior.  “For too long our mental health care system suffered from disinvestment, and the pandemic has only made things harder for New Yorkers with serious mental illness who are experiencing homelessness,” Hochul said in a statement. “We must work together to keep our subways — the lifeblood of New York City — safe for all riders, and to get help and services to those in need.""NBC New York reported that crime on the city's public transit system has climbed by 30 percent, with felony assaults nearly doubling. Police data showed that there were 55 major crimes on the transit system in the week of Feb. 21, compared to 42 the previous week. There were 18 in the same week last year, the station reported."
43,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/600-indian-students-stranded-ukraine-used-social-media-make-home-rcna19717,asian-america,"Hundreds of Indian students have made it home from Ukraine after being stranded at their schools for days with little food or water. Students from universities in Sumy and Odessa told NBC News that inaction from the Indian Embassy led them to take matters into their own hands. “We decided ourselves that we should leave,” Ovais Choudhary, a medical student at Odessa National University, said in an interview translated from Hindi. “The more you wait, the more critical and tense the situation becomes.”Choudhary traveled with a group of 50 students who left their school housing on foot Feb. 24 as tanks rolled through Odessa. They all moved into a set of three apartments where they spent two sleepless nights trying to figure out what to do. The Indian Embassy in Kyiv published several notices from Feb. 18 to March 2 advising Indian nationals to get out of unstable cities in Ukraine and move west. But students say that while these advisories told them where to go, they gave no indication of how to get there.  India evacuates hundreds of trapped Indian students from northeast UkraineMarch 9, 202202:47The Indian Embassy in Kyiv did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Through a Facebook group called “Indians in Ukraine,” Choudhary and his group said they found bus rentals that could take them to Moldova. For the 25-mile journey from Odessa to the border checkpoint, they collectively paid the equivalent of $7,000, an expensive fare for what would normally be a short journey, they said. But reaching the border station was just the beginning of a tumultuous journey, according to Choudhary. When they arrived at the checkpoints the following morning, they said Ukrainian army officials saw their Indian passports and left them. The students say they stood for 18 hours in freezing temperatures, waiting to be given their next instructions. NBC News didn't independently verify these claims, and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Finally, they were allowed to pass, and Choudhary said Red Cross and United Nations personnel aided his group on the other side of the border. They traveled to the Moldovan capital, Chișinău, spent the night in a shelter, and set out for Romania the next morning on a bus that cost them another $2,000. Choudhary was relieved when he finally arrived to the airport in Bucharest, Romania, where he said Indian Embassy officials met them. After a two-day wait in the airport, they finally boarded a plane to New Delhi on March 4. “From Feb 24 to March 4, I didn’t take off my shoes,” Choudhary said. Farther east, in Sumy, a city only 30 miles from the Russian border, hundreds of Indian students were in the center of the violence.“We may not die with this war zone, but we will die with scarcity of water and food,” Sumy University student Shivangi Jaiswal said in a video posted on social media last week. Tagging media organizations and the Indian Embassy in Kyiv, Jaiswal and her peers revealed their plight to an international audience and pleaded for a clear path out. The students in Sumy said they heard gunfire and airstrikes from their residences, where basic needs were becoming scarce. They spent days melting snow for drinking water and rationing the little food they had. Leaving without instructions felt just as dangerous as staying, Jaiswal told NBC News. At least 700 Indian students are stuck in eastern Ukraine&nbsp;March 8, 202202:53Students stuck in Ukraine and advocates abroad said there was never a proper response from the Indian government. “Clear instructions were not available from the Indian Embassy,” Choudhary said. “If any student calls, he will get a different answer.”Online communities began to form, with groups like “Indians in Ukraine” gaining thousands of members. Facebook posts from those stuck in war-torn parts of the country were answered with comments, offering phone numbers of private citizens organizing their own rental buses. Students said they saw progress once their messages on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok went viral. After Ukrainian officials announced civilian evacuation corridors on Tuesday, India began to plan an exit for Sumy students. Hundreds boarded buses and started to make their journey west. Jaiswal described the journey as “very stressful,” adding, “Driver is doing his job and we are doing ours by being calm.” After making the switch to a train in Poltava, in central Ukraine, they arrived in Poland days later. There, they boarded flights from Rzeszow airport to New Delhi, and on Friday, their plane touched down in India.“Coming home finally,” Jaiswal tweeted, along with a photo of her smiling peers waiting to board their plane.
